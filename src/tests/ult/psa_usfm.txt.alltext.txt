blessed
is
the
man
who
does
not
walk
in
the
advice
of
the
wicked
or
stand
in
the
pathway
with
sinners
or
sit
in
the
assembly
of
mockers
but
his
delight
is
in
the
law
of
yahweh
and
on
his
law
he
meditates
day
and
night
he
will
be
like
a
tree
planted
by
the
streams
of
water
that
produces
its
fruit
in
its
season
whose
leaves
do
not
wither
whatever
he
does
will
prosper
the
wicked
are
not
so
but
are
instead
like
the
chaff
that
the
wind
drives
away
so
the
wicked
will
not
stand
in
the
judgment
nor
sinners
in
the
assembly
of
the
righteous
for
yahweh
approves
of
the
way
of
the
righteous
but
the
way
of
the
wicked
will
perish
why
are
the
nations
in
turmoil
and
why
do
the
peoples
make
plots
that
will
fail
the
kings
of
the
earth
take
their
stand
together
and
the
rulers
conspire
together
against
yahweh
and
against
his
messiah
saying
let
us
tear
off
the
shackles
they
put
on
us
and
throw
off
their
chains
he
who
sits
in
the
heavens
will
sneer
at
them
the
lord
mocks
them
then
he
will
speak
to
them
in
his
anger
and
terrify
them
in
his
rage
saying
i
myself
have
anointed
my
king
on
zion
my
holy
mountain
i
will
announce
a
decree
of
yahweh
he
said
to
me
you
are
my
son
this
day
i
have
become
your
father
ask
me
and
i
will
give
you
the
nations
for
your
inheritance
and
the
farthermost
regions
of
the
earth
for
your
possession
you
will
break
them
with
an
iron
rod
like
a
jar
of
a
potter
you
will
smash
them
to
pieces
so
now
you
kings
be
warned
be
corrected
you
rulers
of
the
earth
worship
yahweh
in
fear
and
rejoice
with
trembling
kiss
the
son
or
he
will
be
angry
with
you
and
you
will
die
in
the
way
when
his
anger
burns
for
just
a
moment
how
blessed
are
all
those
who
seek
refuge
in
him
yahweh
how
many
are
my
enemies
many
have
risen
against
me
many
say
about
me
there
is
no
help
for
him
from
god
selah
but
you
yahweh
are
a
shield
around
me
my
glory
and
the
one
who
lifts
up
my
head
i
lift
up
my
voice
to
yahweh
and
he
answers
me
from
his
holy
hill
selah
i
lay
down
and
slept
i
awoke
for
yahweh
protected
me
i
will
not
be
afraid
of
the
multitudes
of
people
who
have
set
themselves
against

on

up
yahweh
save
me
my

hit
all
my

on
the

you
will
break
the

you
spread
our

possession
by

put
to

have
made
our
boast
all
the
day
long
and
we
will
give

to
your

now
you
have
thrown
us
off
and
brought
us
dishonor
and
you
do
not
go
out
with

make
us
turn
back
from
the
adversary
and

who
hate
us
take
spoil
for
themselves

have
made
us
like
sheep
to
be
slaughtered
and
have
scattered
us
among
the
nations
you
sell
your
people
for
nothing
you
have
not
increased
your
wealth
by
doing
so
you
make
us
a
rebuke
to
our
neighbors
scoffed
and
mocked
by
those
around
us

make
us
an
insult
among
the

the
day
long
my
dishonor
is
before
me

of
him
who
rebukes
and
insults
because
of
the
enemy
and
the
avenger

this
has
come
on
us

we
have
not
forgotten
you
or
dealt
falsely
with
your
covenant
our
heart
has
not
turned
back
our
steps
have
not
gone
from
your
way
yet
you
have
severely
broken
us
in
the
place
of
jackals
and
covered
us
with
the
shadow
of
death
if
we
have
forgotten
the
name
of
our
god
or
spread
out
our
hands
to
a
strange
god
would
not
god
search
this
out
for
he
knows
the
secrets
of
the
heart
indeed
for
your
sake
we
are
being
killed
all
day
long
we
are
considered
to
be
sheep
for
the
slaughter
awake
why
do
you
sleep
lord
arise
do
not
throw
us
off
permanently
why
do
you
hide
your
face

our
affliction

sunk
down
into
the
dust
our

hear
this
all
you
peoples
give
ear
all
you
inhabitants
of
the
world
both
low
and
high
rich
and
poor
together
my
mouth
will
speak
wisdom
and
the
meditation
of
my
heart
will
be
of
understanding
i
will
incline
my
ear
to
a
parable
i
will
begin
my
parable
with
the
harp
why
should
i
fear
the
days
of
evil
when
iniquity
surrounds
me
at
my
heels
why
should
i
fear
those
who
trust
in
their
wealth
and
boast
about
the
amount
of
their
riches
it
is
certain
that
no
one
can
redeem
his
brother
or
give
god
a
ransom
for
him
for
the
redemption
of
ones
life
is
costly
and
no
one
can
pay
what
we
owe
no
one
can
live
forever
so
that
his
body
should
not
decay
for
he
will
see
decay
wise
men
die
the
fool
and
the
brute
alike
perish
and
leave
their
wealth
to
others
their
inner
thought
is
that
their
families
will
continue
forever
and
the
places
where
they
live
to
all
generations
they
call
their
lands
after
their
own
names
but
man
having
wealth
does
not
remain
alive
he
is
like
the
beasts
that
perish
this
their
way
is
their
folly
yet
after
them
men
approve
of
their
sayings
selah
like
sheep
they
are
appointed
for
sheol
and
death
will
be
their
shepherd
the
upright
will
rule
over
them

who
did
not
make

he
trusted
in
the
abundance
of
his
wealth
and
he
was
strong
when
he
destroyed
others

filled
with
his
glory
amen
and
amen
the
prayers
of
david
son
of
jesse
are
finished
a
psalm
of
solomon
surely
god
is
good
to
israel
to
those
with
a
pure
heart
but
as
for
me
my
feet
almost
slipped
my
feet
almost
slipped
out
from
under
me
because
i
was
envious
of
the
arrogant
when
i
saw
the
prosperity
of
the
wicked
for
they
have
no
pain
until
their
death
but
they
are
strong
and
well
fed
they
are
free
from
the
burdens
of
other
men
they
are
not
afflicted
like
other
men
pride
adorns
them
like
a
necklace
around
their
neck
violence
clothes
them
like
a
robe
out
of
such
blindness
comes
sin
evil
thoughts
pass
through
their
hearts
they
mock
and
speak
wickedly
in
their
arrogance
they
threaten
oppression
they
set
their
mouth
against
the
heavens
and
their
tongues
march
through
the
earth
therefore
his
people
turn
to
them
and
abundant
waters
are
drained
out
they
say
how
does
god
know
is
there
knowledge
with
the
most
high
take
notice
these
people
are
wicked
they
are
always
carefree
becoming
richer
and
richer
surely
it
is
in
vain
that
i
have
guarded
my
heart
and
washed
my
hands
in
innocence
for
all
the
day
long
i
have
been
afflicted
and
disciplined
every
morning
if
i
had
said
i
will
say
these
things
then
i
would
have
betrayed
this
generation
of
your
children
though
i
tried
to
understand
these
things
it
was
too
difficult
for
me
then
i
went
into
gods
sanctuary
and
came
to
understand
their
fate
surely
you
put
them
in
slippery
places
you
bring
them
down
to
ruin
how
they
become
a
wilderness
in
a
moment
they
come
to
an
end
and
are
finished
in
awful
terrors
they
are
like
a
dream
after
one
wakes
up
lord
when
you
arise
you
will
think
nothing
of
those
dreams
for
my
heart
was
grieved
and
i
was
deeply
wounded
i
was
ignorant
and
lacked
insight
i
was
like
a
senseless
animal
before
you
yet
i
am
always
with
you
you
hold
my
right
hand
you
will
guide
me
with
your
advice
and
afterward
receive
me
to
glory
whom
have
i
in
heaven
but
you
there
is
no
one
on
earth
that
i
desire
but
you
my
flesh
and
my
heart
grow
weak
but
god
is
the
strength
of
my
heart
forever
those
who
are
far
from
you
will
perish
you
will
destroy
all
those
who
are
unfaithful
to
you
but
as
for
me
all
i
need
to
do
is
to
approach
god
i
have
made
the
lord
yahweh
my
refuge
i
will
declare
all
your
deeds
a
psalm
of
asaph
god
why
have
you
rejected
us
forever
why
does
your
anger
burn
against
the
sheep
of
your
pasture
call
to
mind
your
people
whom
you
purchased
in
ancient
times
the
tribe
whom
you
have
redeemed
to
be
your
own
heritage
and
mount
zion
where
you
live
come
look
at
the
complete
ruins
all
the
damage
that
the
enemy
has
done
in
the
holy
place
your
adversaries
roared
in
the
middle
of
your
appointed
place
they
set
up
their
battle
flags
they
hacked
away
with
axes
as
in
a
thick
forest
they
smashed
and
broke
down
all
the
engravings
they
broke
them
with
axes
and
hammers
they
set
your
sanctuary
on
fire
they
desecrated
where
you
live
knocking
it
to
the
ground
they
said
in
their
hearts
we
will
destroy
them
all
they
burned
up
all
of
your
meeting
places
in
the
land
we
do
not
see
any
more
signs
there
is
no
prophet
any
more
and
no
one
among
us
knows
how
long
this
will
last
how
long
god
will
the
enemy
throw
insults
at
you
will
the
enemy
blaspheme
your
name
forever
why
do
you
hold
back
your
hand
your
right
hand
take
your
right
hand
from
your
garment
and
destroy
them
yet
god
has
been
my
king
from
ancient
times
bringing
salvation
on
the
earth
you
divided
the
sea
by
your
strength
you
smashed
the
heads
of
the
sea
monsters
in
the
waters
you
crushed
the
heads
of
leviathan
you
fed
him
to
those
living
in
the
wilderness
you
broke
open
springs
and
streams
you
dried
up
flowing
rivers
the
day
is
yours
and
the
night
is
yours
also
you
set
the
sun
and
moon
in
place
you
have
set
all
the
borders
of
the
earth
you
have
made
summer
and
winter
call
to
mind
how
the
enemy
hurled
insults
at
you
yahweh
and
that
a
foolish
people
has
blasphemed
your
name
do
not
give
the
life
of
your
dove
to
a
wild
animal
do
not
forget
forever
the
life
of
your
oppressed
people
remember
your
covenant
for
the
dark
regions
of
the
land
are
full
of
places
of
violence
do
not
let
the
oppressed
be
turned
back
in
shame
let
the
poor
and
oppressed
praise
your
name
arise
god
defend
your
own
honor
call
to
mind
how
fools
insult
you
all
day
long
do
not
forget
the
voice
of
your
adversaries
or
the
uproar
of

who
continually

it
is
not
from

east
or
from
the
west
and
it
is
not
from
the
wilderness
that
lifting
up
comes
but
god
is
the
judge
he
brings
down
and
he
lifts
up
for
yahweh
holds
in
his
hand
a
cup
of
foaming
wine
which
is
mixed
with
spices
and
pours
it
out
surely
all
the
wicked
of

earth
will
drink
it
to
the
last
drop
but
i
will
continually
tell
what
you
have
done

wonderful

your
deeds

your

god
is

great

you
are
the
god
who
does
wonders
you
have
revealed
your
strength
among
the
peoples
you
gave
your
people
victory
by
your
great
power
the
descendants
of
jacob
and
joseph
selah
the
waters
saw
you
god
the
waters
saw
you
and
they
were
afraid
the
depths
trembled
the
clouds
poured
down
water
the
cloudy
skies
gave
voice
your
arrows
flew
about
your
thunderous
voice
was
heard
in
the
wind
the
lightning
lit
up
the
world
the
earth
trembled
and
shook
your
path
went
through
the
sea
and
your
way
through
the
surging
waters
but
your
footprints
were
not
seen
you
led
your
people
like
a
flock
by
the
hand
of
moses
and
aaron
for
the
chief
musician
after
the
manner

hear
my
teaching
my
people
listen
to
the
words
of
my
mouth
i
will
open
my
mouth
in
parables
i
will
sing
about
hidden
things
about
the
past
these
are
things
that
we
have
heard
and
learned
things
that
our
ancestors
have
told
us
we
will
not
keep
them
from
their
descendants
we
will
tell
the
next
generation
about
the
praiseworthy
deeds
of
yahweh
his
strength
and
the
wonders
that
he
has
done
for
he
established
covenant
decrees
in
jacob
and
appointed
a
law
in
israel
he
commanded
our
ancestors
that
they
were
to
teach
them
to
their
children
he
commanded
this
so
that
the
generation
to
come
might
know
his
decrees
the
children
not
yet
born
who
should
tell
them
in
turn
to
their
own
children
then
they
would
place
their
hope
in
god
and
not
forget
his
deeds
but
keep
his
commandments
then
they
would
not
be
like
their
ancestors
who
were
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
generation
a
generation
whose
hearts
were
not
right
and
whose
spirits
were
not
committed
and
faithful
to
god
the
ephraimites
were
armed
with
bows
but
they
turned
back
on
the
day
of
battle
they
did
not
keep
the
covenant
with
god
and
they
refused
to
obey
his
law
they
forgot
his
deeds
the
wonderful
things
that
he
had
shown
them
they
forgot
the
marvelous
things
he
did
in
the
sight
of
their
ancestors
in
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
land
of
zoan
he
divided
the
sea
and
led
them
across
it
he
made
the
waters
to
stand
like
walls
in
the
daytime
he
led
them
with
a
cloud
and
all
the
night
with
the
light
of
fire
he
split
the
rocks
in
the
wilderness
and
he
gave
them
water
abundantly
enough
to
fill
the
depths
of
the
sea
he
made
streams
flow
out
of
the
rock
and
made
the
water
flow
like
rivers
yet
they
continued
to
sin
against
him
rebelling
against
the
most
high
in
the
wilderness
they
challenged
god
in
their
hearts
by
asking
for
food
to
satisfy
their
appetites
they
spoke
against
god
they
said
can
god
really
lay
out
a
table
for
us
in
the
wilderness
see
when
he
struck
the
rock
waters
gushed
out
and
streams
overflowed
but
can
he
give
bread
also
will
he
provide
meat
for
his
people
when
yahweh
heard
this
he
was
angry
so
his
fire
burned
against
jacob
and
his
anger
attacked
israel
because
they
did
not
believe
in
god
and
did
not
trust
in
his
salvation
yet
he
commanded
the
skies
above
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
sky
he
rained
down
manna
for
them
to
eat
and
gave
them
the
grain
from
heaven
people
ate
the
bread
of
angels
he
sent
them
food
in
abundance
he
caused
the
east
wind
to
blow
in
the
sky
and
by
his
power
he
guided
the
south
wind
he
rained
down
meat
on
them
like
dust
birds
as
numerous
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
they
fell
in
the
middle
of
their
camp
all
around
their
tents
so
they
ate
and
were
full
he
gave
them
what
they
craved
but
they
had
not
yet
filled
up
their
food
was
still
in
their
mouths
then
gods
anger
attacked
them
and
killed
the
strongest
of
them
he
brought
down
the
young
men
of
israel
despite
this
they
continued
to
sin
and
did
not
believe
his
wonderful
deeds
therefore
god
cut
short
their
days
their
years
were
filled
with
terror
whenever
god
afflicted
them
they
would
start
to
seek
him
and
they
would
return
and
look
earnestly
for
him
they
would
call
to
mind
that
god
was
their
rock
and
that
the
most
high
god
was
their
rescuer
but
they
would
flatter
him
with
their
mouth
and
lie
to
him
with
their
words
for
their
hearts
were
not
firmly
fixed
on
him
and
they
were
not
faithful
to
his
covenant
yet
he
being
merciful
forgave
their
iniquity
and
did
not
destroy
them
yes
many
times
he
held
back
his
anger
and
did
not
stir
up
all
his
wrath
he
called
to
mind
that
they
were
made
of
flesh
a
wind
that
passes
away
and
does
not
return
how
often
they
rebelled
against
him
in
the
wilderness
and
grieved
him
in
the
barren
regions
again
and
again
they
challenged
god
and
offended
the
holy
one
of
israel
they
did
not
think
about
his
power
how
he
had
rescued
them
from
the
enemy
when
he
performed
his
terrifying
signs
in
egypt
and
his
wonders
in
the
region
of
zoan
he
turned
the
egyptians
rivers
to
blood
so
that
they
could
not
drink
from
their
streams
he
sent
swarms
of
flies
that
devoured
them
and
frogs
that
overran
their
land
he
gave
their
crops
to
the
grasshopper
and
their
labor
to
the
locust
he
destroyed
their
vines
with
hail
and
their
sycamore
trees
with
more
hail
he
rained
hail
on
their
cattle
and
hurled
lightning
bolts
at
their
livestock
the
fierceness
of
his
anger
lashed
out
against
them
he
sent
wrath
fury
and
trouble
like
agents
who
bring
disaster
he
leveled
a
path
for
his
anger
he
did
not
spare
them
from
death
but
gave
them
over
to
the
plague
he
killed
all
the
firstborn
in
egypt
the
firstborn
of
their
strength
in
the
tents
of
ham
he
led
his
own
people
out
like
sheep
and
guided
them
through
the
wilderness
like
a
flock
he
led
them
secure
and
unafraid
but
the
sea
overwhelmed
their
enemies
then
he
brought
them
to
the
border
of
his
holy
land
to
this
mountain
that
his
right
hand
acquired
he
drove
out
the
nations
from
before
them
and
assigned
them
their
inheritance
he
settled
the
tribes
of
israel
in
their
tents
yet
they
challenged
and
defied
the
most
high
god
and
did
not
keep
his
solemn
commands
they
were
unfaithful
and
acted
treacherously
like
their
fathers
they
were
as
undependable
as
a
faulty
bow
for
they
made
him
angry
with
their
high
places
and
provoked
him
to
jealous
anger
with
their
idols
when
god
heard
this
he
was
angry
and
completely
rejected
israel
he
abandoned
the
sanctuary
of
shiloh
the
tent
where
he
had
lived
among
people
he
allowed
his
strength
to
be
captured
and
gave
his
glory
into
the
enemys
hand
he
handed
his
people
over
to
the
sword
and
he
was
angry
with
his
heritage
fire
devoured
their
young
men
and
their
young
women
had
no
wedding
songs
their
priests
fell
by
the
sword
and
their
widows
could
not
weep
then
the
lord
awakened
as
one
from
sleep
like
a
warrior
who
shouts
because
of
wine
he
drove
his
adversaries
back
he
put
them
to
everlasting
shame
he
rejected
the
tent
of
joseph
and
he
did
not
chose
the
tribe
of
ephraim
he
chose
the
tribe
of
judah
and
mount
zion
that
he
loved
he
built
his
sanctuary
like
the
heavens
like
the
earth
that
he
has
established
forever
he
chose
david
his
servant
and
took
him
from
the
sheepfolds
he
took
him
from
following
the
ewes
with
their
young
and
he
brought
him
to
be
shepherd
of
jacob
his
people
and
of
israel
his
heritage
david
shepherded
them
with
the
integrity
of
his
heart
and
he
guided
them
with
the
skill
of
his
hands

come
into

have
defiled

have
turned

the

mocking
and
derision

those
who
are
around

how
long

will
you
stay
angry
forever
how
long
will
your
jealous
anger
burn
like
fire
pour
out
your
wrath
on
the
nations
that
do
not
know
you
and
on
the
kingdoms
that
do
not
call
upon

that
was
shed
be
avenged

our
sins
from
us
as
a
father
has
compassion
on
his
children
so
yahweh
has
compassion
on
those
who
honor
him
for
he
knows
how
we
are
formed
he
knows
that
we
are
dust
as
for
man
his
days
are
like
grass
he
flourishes
like
a
flower
in
a
field
the
wind
blows
over
it
and
it
disappears
and
no
one
can
even
tell
where
it
once
grew

of
yahweh
is
from
everlasting
to
everlasting

he
is
yahweh
our
god
his
decrees
are
on
all
the
earth
he
keeps
in
mind
his
covenant
forever
the
word
that
he
commanded
for
a
thousand
generations
he
calls
to
mind
the
covenant
that
he
made
with
abraham
and
his
oath
to
isaac
this
is
what
he
confirmed
to
jacob
as
a
statute
and
to
israel
as
an
everlasting
covenant
he
said
i
will
give
you
the
land
of
canaan
as
your
share
of
your
inheritance
he
said
this
when
they
were
only
few
in
number
so
very
few
and
were
strangers
in
the
land
they
went
from
nation
to
nation
and
from
one
kingdom
to
another
he
did
not
allow
anyone
to
oppress
them
he
rebuked
kings
for
their
sakes
he
said
do
not
touch
my
anointed
ones
and
do
not
harm
my
prophets
he
called
for
a
famine
on
the
land
he
cut
off
the
whole
supply
of
bread
he
sent
a
man
ahead
of
them
joseph
was
sold
as
a
servant
his
feet
were
bound
by
shackles
on
his
neck
was
put
an
iron
collar
until
what
he
had
said
came
to
pass
the
word
of
yahweh
tested
him
the
king
sent
servants
to
release
him
the
ruler
of
the
people
set
him
free
he
put
him
in
charge
of
his
house
as
ruler
of
all
his
possessions
to
instruct
his
princes
as
he
wished
and
to
teach
his
elders
wisdom
then
israel
came
into
egypt
and
jacob
lived
for
a
time
in
the
land
of
ham
yahweh
made
his
people
fruitful
and
made
them
stronger
than
their
enemies
he
caused
their
enemies
to
hate
his
people
to
mistreat
his
servants
he
sent
moses
his
servant
and
aaron
whom
he
had
chosen
they
performed
his
signs
among
the
egyptians
his
wonders
in
the
land
of
ham
he
sent
darkness
and
made
that
land
dark
but
its
people
did
not
obey
his
commands
he
turned
their
water
into
blood
and
killed
their
fish
their
land
swarmed
with
frogs
even
in
the
rooms
of
their
rulers
he
spoke
and
swarms
of
flies
and
gnats
came
throughout
their
country
he
turned
their
rain
into
hail
with
fire
flaming
on
their
land
he
destroyed
their
vines
and
fig
trees
he
broke
the
trees
of
their
country
he
spoke
and
the
locusts
came
so
many
locusts
the
locusts
ate
up
all
of
the
vegetation
in
their
land
they
ate
up
all
the
crops
of
the
ground
he
killed
every
firstborn
in
their
land
the
firstfruits
of
all
their
strength
he
brought
the
israelites
out
with
silver
and
gold
none
of
his
tribes
stumbled
on
the
way
egypt
was
glad
when
they
went
away
for
the
egyptians
were
afraid
of
them
he
spread
a
cloud
for
a
covering
and
made
a
fire
to
light
up
the
night
the
israelites
asked
for
food
and
he
brought
quail
and
satisfied
them
with
bread
from
heaven
he
split
the
rock
and
waters
gushed
from
it
they
flowed
in
the
wilderness
like
a
river
for
he
called
to
mind
his
holy
promise
that
he
made
to
abraham
his
servant
he
led
his
people
out
with
joy
his
chosen
with
shouts
of
triumph
he
gave
them
the
lands
of
the
nations
they
took
possession
of
the
wealth
of
the
peoples
so
that
they
might
keep
his
statutes
and
obey
his
laws
praise
yahweh
praise
yahweh
give
thanks
to
yahweh
for
he
is
good
for
his
covenant
faithfulness
endures
forever
who
can
recount
the
mighty
acts
of
yahweh
or
proclaim
in
full
all
his
praiseworthy
deeds
blessed
are
those
who
do
what
is
right
and
whose
deeds
are
always
just
call
me
to
mind
yahweh
when
you
show
favor
to
your
people
help
me
when
you
save
them
then
i
will
see
the
prosperity
of
your
chosen
rejoice
in
the
gladness
of
your
nation
and
glory
with
your
inheritance
we
have
sinned
like
our
ancestors
we
have
done
wrong
and
we
have
done
evil
our
fathers
did
not
appreciate
your
marvelous
deeds
in
egypt
they
ignored
your
many
acts
of
covenant
faithfulness
they
were
rebellious
at
the
sea
the
sea
of
reeds
nevertheless
he
saved
them
for
his
names
sake
so
that
he
might
reveal
his
power
he
rebuked
the
sea
of
reeds
and
it
dried
up
then
he
led
them
through
the
depths
as
through
a
wilderness
he
saved
them
from
the
hand
of
those
who
hated
them
and
he
rescued
them
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
but
the
waters
covered
their
adversaries
not
one
of
them
survived
then
they
believed
his
words
and
they
sang
his
praise
but
they
quickly
forgot
what
he
had
done
they
did
not
wait
for
his
instructions
they
had
insatiable
cravings
in
the
wilderness
and
they
challenged
god
in
the
desert
so
he
gave
them
what
they
requested
but
he
sent
a
horrible
disease
upon
them
in
the
camp
they
became
jealous
of
moses
and
aaron
the
holy
priest
of
yahweh
the
earth
opened
and
swallowed
up
dathan
and
covered
the
followers
of
abiram
fire
broke
out
among
them
the
fire
consumed
the
wicked
they
made
a
calf
at
horeb
and
worshiped
a
cast
metal
figure
they
traded
the
glory
of
god
for
the
image
of
a
bull
that
eats
grass
they
forgot
god
their
savior
who
had
done
great
deeds
in
egypt
he
had
done
wonderful
things
in
the
land
of
ham
and
mighty
acts
at
the
sea
of
reeds
so
he
said
he
would
destroy
them
had
not
moses
his
chosen
one
stood
in
the
breach
before
him
to
turn
away
his
anger
from
destroying
them
then
they
despised
the
fruitful
land
they
did
not
believe
his
promise
but
grumbled
in
their
tents
and
did
not
obey
yahweh
therefore
he
raised
his
hand
and
swore
to
them
that
he
would
let
them
die
in
the
desert
scatter
their
descendants
among
the
nations
and
scatter
them
in
foreign
lands
they
worshiped
the
baal
of
peor
and
ate
the
sacrifices
offered
to
the
dead
they
provoked
him
to
anger
with
their
actions
and
a
plague
broke
out
among
them
then
phinehas
rose
to
intervene
and
the
plague
subsided
it
was
counted
to
him
as
a
righteous
deed
to
all
generations
forever
they
also
angered
yahweh
at
the
waters
of
meribah
and
moses
suffered
because
of
them
they
made
moses
bitter
and
he
spoke
rashly
they
did
not
destroy
the
nations
as
yahweh
had
commanded
them
but
they
mingled
with
the
nations
and
learned
their
ways
and
worshiped
their
idols
which
became
a
snare
to
them
they
sacrificed
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
demons
they
shed
innocent
blood
the
blood
of
their
sons
and
of
their
daughters
whom
they
sacrificed
to
the
idols
of
canaan
desecrating
the
land
with
blood
they
were
defiled
by
their
deeds
in
their
actions
they
were
like
prostitutes
so
yahweh
was
angry
with
his
people
and
he
despised
his
own
people
he
gave
them
into
the
hand
of
the
nations
and
those
who
hated
them
ruled
over
them
their
enemies
oppressed
them
and
they
were
brought
into
subjection
to
their
authority
many
times
he
came
to
help
them
but
they
kept
rebelling
and
were
brought
low
by
their
own
sin
nevertheless
he
paid
attention
to
their
distress
when
he
heard
their
cry
for
help
he
called
to
mind
his
covenant
with
them
and
relented
because
of
his
steadfast
love
he
caused
all
their
conquerers
to
have
pity
on
them
save
us
yahweh
our
god
gather
us
from
among
the
nations
so
that
we
may
give
thanks
to
your
holy
name
and
glory
in
your
praises
may
yahweh
the
god
of
israel
be
praised
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
all
the
people
said
amen
praise
yahweh
give
thanks
to
yahweh
for
he
is
good
and
his
covenant
faithfulness
endures
forever
let
the
redeemed
of
yahweh
speak
out
those
he
has
rescued
from
the
hand
of
the
enemy
he
has
gathered
them
out
of
foreign
lands
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
from
the
north
and
from
the
south
they
wandered
in
the
wilderness
on
a
desert
road
and
found
no
city
in
which
to
live
because
they
were
hungry
and
thirsty
they
fainted
from
exhaustion
then
they
called
out
to
yahweh
in
their
trouble
and
he
rescued
them
out
of
their
distress
he
led
them
by
a
direct
path
so
that
they
would
go
to
a
city
to
live
in
oh
that
people
would
praise
yahweh
for
his
covenant
faithfulness
and
for
the
amazing
things
he
has
done
for
humanity
for
he
satisfies
the
longings
of
those
who
are
thirsty
and
the
desires
of
those
who
are
hungry
he
fills
up
with
good
things
some
sat
in
darkness
and
in
gloom
prisoners
in
affliction
and
chains
this
was
because
they
had
rebelled
against
gods
word
and
rejected
the
instruction
of
the
most
high
he
humbled
their
hearts
through
hardship
they
stumbled
and
there
was
no
one
to
help
them
up
then
they
called
out
to
yahweh
in
their
trouble
and
he
brought
them
out
of
their
distress
he
brought
them
out
of
darkness
and
gloom
and
broke
their
bonds
oh
that
people
would
praise
yahweh
for
his
covenant
faithfulness
and
for
the
amazing
things
he
has
done
for
humanity
for
he
has
broken
the
gates
of
bronze
and
cut
through
the
bars
of
iron
they
were
foolish
in
their
rebellious
ways
and
afflicted
because
of
their
sins
they
lost
their
desire
to
eat
any
food
and
they
came
close
to
the
gates
of
death
then
they
called
out
to
yahweh
in
their
trouble
and
he
brought
them
out
of
their
distress
he
sent
his
word
and
healed
them
and
he
rescued
them
from
their
destruction
oh
that
people
would
praise
yahweh
for
his
covenant
faithfulness
and
for
the
amazing
things
he
has
done
for
humanity
let
them
offer
the
sacrifices
of
thanksgiving
and
proclaim
his
deeds
in
singing
some
travel
on
the
sea
in
ships
and
do
business
overseas
these
saw
the
deeds
of
yahweh
and
his
wonders
on
the
seas
for
he
commanded
and
aroused
the
windstorm
that
stirs
up
the
seas
they
reached
up
to
the
sky
they
went
down
to
the
depths
their
lives
melted
away
in
distress
they
swayed
and
staggered
like
drunkards
and
were
at
their
wits
end
then
they
called
out
to
yahweh
in
their
trouble
and
he
brought
them
out
of
their
distress
he
calmed
the
storm
and
the
waves
were
stilled
then
they
rejoiced
because
the
sea
was
calm
and
he
brought
them
to
their
desired
harbor
oh
that
people
would
praise
yahweh
for
his
covenant
faithfulness
and
for
the
amazing
things
he
has
done
for
humanity
let
them
exalt
him
in
the
assembly
of
the
people
and
praise
him
in
the
council
of
the
elders
he
turns
rivers
into
a
wilderness
springs
of
water
into
dry
land
and
a
fruitful
land
into
a
barren
place
because
of
the
wickedness
of
its
people
he
turns
the
wilderness
into
a
pool
of
water
and
dry
land
into
springs
of
water
he
settles
the
hungry
there
and
they
build
a
city
to
live
in
they
build
a
city
to
plant
fields
in
to
plant
vineyards
and
to

may
their
guilt
always
be
before
yahweh
may
yahweh
cut
off
their
memory
from
the
earth
may
yahweh
do
this
because
this
man
never
bothered
to
show
any
covenant
faithfulness
but
instead
harassed
the
oppressed
the
needy
and
the
disheartened
to
death
he
loved
cursing
may
it
come
back
upon
him
he
hated
blessing
may
no
blessing
come
to
him
he
clothed
himself
with
cursing
as
his
garment
and
his
curse
came
into
his
inner
being
like
water
like
oil
into
his
bones
may
his
curses
be
to
him
like
the
clothes
he
wears

wears

torrent
would
have
overwhelmed
us
then
the
raging
waters
would
have
drowned
us
blessed
be
yahweh
who
has
not
allowed
us
to
be
torn
by
their
teeth
we
have
escaped
like
a
bird
out
of
the
snare
of
the
fowlers
the
snare
has
been
broken
and
we
have
escaped
our
help
is
in
yahweh
who
made
heaven
and
earth
a
song
of
ascents
of
david
those
who
trust
in
yahweh
are
like
mount
zion
unshakable
forever
enduring
as
the
mountains
surround
jerusalem
so
yahweh
surrounds
his
people
now
and
forever
the
scepter
of
wickedness
must
not
rule
in
the
land
of
the
righteous
otherwise
the
righteous
might
do
what
is
wrong
do
good
yahweh
to
those
who
are
good
and
to
those
who
are
upright
in
their
hearts
but
as
for
those
who
turn
aside
to
their
crooked
ways
yahweh
will
lead
them
away
with
the
evildoers
may
peace
be
on
israel
a
song
of
ascents
when
yahweh
restored
the
fortunes
of
zion
we
were
like
those
who
dream
then
our
mouths
were
filled
with
laughter
and
our
tongues
with
singing
then
they
said
among
the
nations
yahweh
has
done
great
things
for
them
yahweh
did
great
things
for
us
how
glad
we
were
restore
our
fortunes
yahweh
like
the
streams
in
the
negev
those
who
sow
in
tears
will
reap
with
shouts
of
joy
he
who
goes
out
weeping
carrying
seed
for
sowing
will
return
again
with
shouts
of
joy
bringing
his
bundles
of
grain
with
him
a
song
of
ascents
unless
yahweh
builds
the
house
they
work
uselessly
those
who
build
it
unless
yahweh
guards
the
city
the
watchman
stands
guard
uselessly
it
is
useless
for
you
to
rise
up
early
to
come
home
late
or
to
eat
the
bread
of
hard
work
for
yahweh
provides
for
his
beloved
as
they
sleep
see
children
are
a
heritage
from
yahweh
and
the
fruit
of
the
womb
is
a
reward
from
him
like
arrows
in
the
hand
of
a
warrior
so
are
the
children
of
ones
youth
how
blessed
is
the
man
that
has
his
quiver
full
of
them
he
will
not
be
put
to
shame
when
he
confronts
his
enemies
in
the
gate
a
song
of
ascents
of
solomon
blessed
is
everyone
who
honors
yahweh
who
walks
in
his
ways
what
your
hands
provide
you
will
enjoy
you
will
be
blessed
and
prosper
your
wife
will
be
like
a
fruitful
vine
in
your
house
your
children
will
be
like
olive
plants
as
they
sit
around
your
table
yes
indeed
the
man
will
be
blessed
who
honors
yahweh
may
yahweh
bless
you
from
zion
may
you
see
the
prosperity
of
jerusalem
all
the
days
of
your
life
may
you
live
to
see
your
childrens
children
may
peace
be
on
israel
a
song
of
ascents
often
since
my
youth
they
have
attacked
me
let
israel
say
often
since
my
youth
they
have
attacked
me
yet
they
have
not
defeated
me
the
plowers
plowed
on
my
back
they
made
their
furrows
long
yahweh
is
righteous
he
has
cut
the
ropes
of
the
wicked
may
they
all
be
put
to
shame
and
turned
back
those
who
hate
zion
may
they
be
like
the
grass
on
the
housetops
that
withers
before
it
grows
up
that
cannot
fill
the
reapers
hand
or
the
chest
of
the
one
who
binds
bundles
of
grain
together
may
those
who
pass
by
not
say
may
the
blessing
of
yahweh
be
on
you
we
bless
you
in
the
name
of
yahweh
a

to
you
yahweh

my
voice
let
your
ears
be
attentive
to
my
pleas
for

by

when

about

on
the
poplars
there
we
hung
our
harps
there
our
captors
required
songs
from
us
and
those
who
mocked
us
required
us
to
be
happy
saying
sing
us
one
of
the
songs
of
zion
how
could
we
sing
a
song
about
yahweh
in

ignore
the
memory
of
you
jerusalem
let
my

forget
her
skill
let

cling

the
roof

you
no
more
if

more
than
my

did
on
