paul
a
servant
of
god
and
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
for
the
faith
of
the
chosen
people
of
god
and
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
that
agrees
with
godliness
with
the
certain
hope
of
everlasting
life
that
god
promised
before
all
the
ages
of
time
but
at
the
right
time
he
revealed
his
by
the
proclamation
that
i
was
entrusted
with
by
the
command
of
god
our
to
titus
a
true
son
in
our
common
faith
grace
and
peace
from
god
the
father
and
christ
jesus
our
for
this
purpose
i
left
you
in
crete
that
you
might
set
in
order
and
ordain
elders
in
every
city
as
i
directed
you
must
be
blameless
the
husband
of
one
wife
having
faithful
children
not
of
reckless
behavior
or
rebellion
it
is
necessary
for
the
overseer
as
the
household
manager
of
god
to
be
blameless
he
must
not
be
arrogant
not
be
easily
angered
not
addicted
to
wine
not
a
brawler
and
not
a
greedy
man
instead
he
should
be
hospitable
a
friend
of
what
is
good
sensible
righteous
holy
and
self
controlled
he
should
hold
tightly
to
the
trustworthy
message
that
is
in
accordance
with
the
teaching
so
that
he
may
be
able
both
to
encourage
others
with
and
rebuke
for
there
are
many
people
both
rebellious
empty
talkers
and
deceivers
especially
those
of
the
circumcision
it
is
necessary
to
stop
them
they
are
upsetting
whole
households
teaching
what
they
should
not
for
the
sake
of
shameful
profit
one
of
prophets
has
said
cretans
are
always
liars
evil
beasts
lazy
bellies
this
is
true
rebuke
them
severely
so
that
they
may
be
sound
in
the
faith
not
paying
any
attention
to
jewish
myths
or
to
the
commands
of
people
who
turn
away
from
the
truth
all
things
are
pure
but
to
those
who
are
corrupt
and
unbelieving
nothing
is
pure
but
both
their
and
their
consciences
have
been
corrupted
they
profess
to
know
god
but
they
deny
him
by
their
actions
they
are
detestable
and
disobedient
and
unfit
for
any
good
work
but
you
speak
what
fits
teaching
older
men
are
to
be
temperate
dignified
sensible
sound
older
women
likewise
are
to
be
reverent
not
slanderers
or
being
slaves
to
much
wine
but
to
be
teachers
of
what
is
good
in
this
way
they
may
train
the
younger
women
to
be
lovers
of
their
husbands
and
lovers
of
their
children
to
be
sensible
pure
good
housekeepers
and
subject
to
their
own
husbands
so
that
the
word
may
not
be
insulted
in
the
same
way
exhort
the
younger
men
to
be
sensible
in
all
ways
present
yourself
as
an
example
of
good
works
in
your
teaching
be
uncorrupted
with
dignity
and
a
sound
message
that
is
above
criticism
so
that
the
may
be
ashamed
because
they
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
us
slaves
are
to
be
subject
to
their
masters
in
everything
to
be
pleasing
and
not
to
argue
not
to
steal
but
instead
to
demonstrate
all
good
faith
so
that
in
every
way
they
may
bring
credit
to
the
teaching
about
god
our
for
the
grace
has
appeared
for
salvation
of
all
people
training
us
so
that
rejecting
and
passions
we
might
live
in
a
sensible
and
righteous
and
godly
way
in
the
present
age
while
we
look
forward
to
receiving
the
blessed
hope
and
appearing
of
the
glory
of
our
great
god
and
savior
jesus
christ
jesus
gave
himself
for
us
in
order
to
redeem
us
from
all
lawlessness
and
to
purify
for
himself
a
special
people
zealous
for
good
works
speak
of
these
things
and
exhort
and
rebuke
with
all
authority
let
no
one
disregard
you
remind
them
to
submit
to
rulers
and
authorities
to
obey
them
to
be
ready
for
every
good
work
to
revile
no
one
to
avoid
quarreling
and
to
be
gentle
showing
all
humility
toward
for
once
we
also
were
foolish
and
disobedient
we
were
led
astray
and
enslaved
by
various
passions
and
pleasures
we
lived
in
evil
and
envy
detestable
and
hating
one
another
but
when
the
kindness
god
our
and
his
love
for
mankind
appeared
it
was
not
by
works
that
we
did
but
by
mercy
that
he
saved
us
through
the
washing
of
new
birth
and
renewal
by
the
holy
spirit
whom
god
richly
poured
on
us
through
our
jesus
christ
so
that
having
been
justified
grace
we
might
become
heirs
according
to
the
certain
hope
of
everlasting
life
this
message
is
trustworthy
i
want
you
to
insist
these
things
so
that
god
may
be
careful
to
engage
themselves
in
good
works
these
things
are
good
and
useful
but
avoid
foolish
debates
and
genealogies
and
strife
and
conflict
about
the
law
because
they
are
unprofitable
and
worthless
reject
a
divisive
person
after
one
or
two
warnings
knowing
that
has
turned
from
the
right
way
and
is
sinning
being
self
condemned
when
i
send
artemas
or
tychicus
to
you
hurry
to
come
to
me
at
nicopolis
because
i
have
decided
to
spend
the
winter
there
diligently
send
on
their
way
zenas
the
lawyer
and
apollos
so
that
they
lack
nothing
must
learn
to
engage
themselves
in
good
works
toward
needs
in
order
not
to
be
unfruitful
all
those
who
are
with
me
greet
you
greet
us
in
faith
be
with
all
of
you
