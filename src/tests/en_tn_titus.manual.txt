Titus about? Paul wrote this letter to Titus, his fellow 
worker, who was leading the churches on the island of

described how the believers should behave towards each other. And 
he encouraged them all to live in a way that 
pleases God. How should the title of this book be 
translated? Translators may choose to call this book by its

such as “Paul’s Letter to Titus” or “A Letter to
