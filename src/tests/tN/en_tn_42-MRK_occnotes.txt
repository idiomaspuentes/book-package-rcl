# Introduction to the Gospel of Mark<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Mark<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1-13)<br>1. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee<br>- Early ministry (1:14-3:6)<br>- Jesus becomes more popular among the people (3:7-5:43)<br>- Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1-8:26)<br>1. Progress toward Jerusalem, repeated times when Jesus predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27-10:52)<br>1. Last days of ministry and preparation for final conflict in Jerusalem (11:1-13:37)<br>1. The death of Christ and the empty tomb (14:1-16:8)<br><br>### What is the Book of Mark about?<br><br>The Gospel of Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Mark wrote much about how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. He did this to encourage his readers who were being persecuted. Mark also explained Jewish customs and some Aramaic words. This may indicate that Mark expected most of his first readers to be Gentiles.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Mark,” or “The Gospel according to Mark.” They may also choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Mark wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Mark?<br><br>The book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was Mark. Mark was also known as John Mark. He was a close friend of Peter. Mark may not have witnessed what Jesus said and did. But many scholars think that Mark wrote in his gospel what Peter told him about Jesus.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What were Jesus’ teaching methods?<br><br>The people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in similar ways as other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”<br><br>The texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?<br><br>In the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” It is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In this passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” That means the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to the son of man to rule over the nations forever. And all the people will worship him forever.<br><br>Jews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. Therefore, Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])<br><br>Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>### Why does Mark frequently use terms indicating short periods of time?<br><br>The Gospel of Mark uses the word “immediately” forty-two times. Mark does this to make the events more exciting and vivid. It moves the reader quickly from one event to the next.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Mark?<br><br>The following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to include these verses. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these verses, the translators can include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Mark’s Gospel.<br><br>* “If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” (7:16)<br>* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:44)<br>* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:46)<br>* “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted with the lawless ones’” (15:28)<br><br>The following passage in not found in the earliest manuscripts. Most Bibles include this passage, but modern Bibles put it in brackets ([]) or indicate in some way that this passage may not have been original to Mark’s Gospel. Translators are advised to do something similar as the modern versions of the Bible.<br><br>* “Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. They heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, but they did not believe. After these things he appeared in a different form to two of them, as they were walking out into the country. They went and told the rest of the disciples, but they did not believe them. Jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he rose from the dead. He said to them, ‘Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to the entire creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, and he who does not believe will be condemned. These signs will go with those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new languages. They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.’ After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. The disciples left and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that went with them.” (16:9-20)<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br><br>
# Mark 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:2-3, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “You can make me clean”<br>Leprosy was a disease of the skin that made a person unclean and unable to properly worship God. Jesus is capable of making people physically “clean” or healthy as well as spiritually “clean” or right with God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])<br><br>### “The kingdom of God is near”<br><br>Scholars debate whether the “kingdom of God” was present at this time or is something that is still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase “at hand,” but this can create difficulty for translators. Other versions use the phase “is coming” and “has come near.”<br>
The book of Mark begins with the prophet Isaiah’s foretelling of the coming of John the Baptist, who baptizes Jesus. The author is Mark, also called John Mark, who is the son of one of the several women named Mary mentioned in the four Gospels. He is also the nephew of Barnabas.
This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
This is an idiom that means “ahead of you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
Here the word “your” refers to Jesus and is singular. When you translate this, use the pronoun “your” because this is a quote from a prophet, and he did not use Jesus’ name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
This refers to the messenger.
Doing this represents preparing the people for the Lord’s arrival. Alternate translation: “will prepare the people for your arrival” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This can be expressed as a sentence. Alternate translation: “The voice of one calling out in the wilderness is heard” or “They hear the sound of someone calling out in the wilderness”
These two phrases mean the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
“Get the road ready for the Lord.” Doing this represents being prepared to hear the Lord’s message when he comes. People do this by repenting of their sins. Alternate translation: “Prepare to hear the Lord’s message when he comes” or “Repent and be ready for the Lord to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
In these verses the words “he,” “him,” and “his” refer to John.
Be sure your reader understands that John was the messenger spoken of by the prophet Isaiah in the previous verse.
The words “whole country” are a metaphor for the people who live in the country and a generalization that refers to a great number of people, not to every single person. Alternate translation: “Many people from Judea and Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
They did these things at the same time. The people were baptized because they repented of their sins. Alternate translation: “When they repented of their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
“John proclaimed”
John is comparing himself to a servant to show how great Jesus is. Alternate translation: “I am not even worthy to do the lowly task of removing his shoes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
At the time Jesus was on earth, people often wore sandals that were made of leather and tied to their feet with leather straps.
“bend down”
This metaphor compares John’s baptism with water to the future baptism with the Holy Spirit. This means John’s baptism only symbolically cleanses people of their sins. The baptism by the Holy Spirit will truly cleanse people of their sins. If possible, use the same word for “baptize” here as you used for John’s baptism to keep the comparison between the two. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This marks the beginning of a new event in the story line. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “John baptized him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
Possible meanings are 1) this is a simile, and the Spirit descended upon Jesus as a bird descends from the sky toward the ground or 2) the Spirit literally looked like a dove as he descended upon Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
This represents God speaking. Sometimes people avoid referring directly to God because they respect him. Alternate translation: “God spoke from the heavens” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
This is an important title for Jesus. The Father calls Jesus his “beloved Son” because of his eternal love for him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
After Jesus’ baptism, he is in the wilderness for 40 days and then goes to Galilee to teach and call his disciples.
“forced Jesus to go out”
“He stayed in the wilderness”
“40 days” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
“He was among”
“after John was placed in prison.” This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “after they arrested John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
“telling many people about the good news”
“It is now time”
“it is almost time for God to begin to rule over his people”
“Jesus saw Simon and Andrew”
The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “throwing a net into the water to catch fish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“Follow me” or “Come with me”
This metaphor means Simon and Andrew will teach people God’s true message, so others will also follow Jesus. Alternate translation: “I will teach you to gather men to me like you gather fish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
It can be assumed that this boat belongs to James and John. Alternate translation: “in their boat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“repairing the nets”
It may be helpful to state clearly why Jesus called to James and John. Alternate translation: “called them to come with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“servants who worked for them”
James and John went with Jesus.
Jesus teaches in the synagogue of the town of Capernaum on the Sabbath. By sending a demon out of a man he amazes the people in all the nearby area around Galilee.
“arrived at Capernaum”
The idea of “teach” can be stated clearly when talking about “someone who has authority” and “the scribes.” Alternate translation: “for he was teaching them as someone who has authority teaches and not as the scribes teach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
The demons ask this rhetorical question meaning there is no reason for Jesus to interfere with them and that they desire him to leave them. Alternate translation: “Jesus of Nazareth, leave us alone! There is no reason for you to interfere with us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The demons ask this rhetorical question to urge Jesus not to harm them. Alternate translation: “Do not destroy us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Here the word “him” refers to the demon-possessed man.
The demon is the one who is crying out, not the man.
The people used the two questions to show how amazed they were. The questions can be expressed as exclamations. Alternate translation: “they said to each other, ‘This is amazing! He gives a new teaching, and he speaks with authority!…and they obey him!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The word “He” refers to Jesus.
After healing the demon-possessed man, Jesus healed Simon’s mother-in-law and many other people.
The word “Now” introduces Simon’s mother-in-law to the story and gives background information about her. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
“caused her to stand” or “made her able to get out of bed”
You may want to make explicit who healed her. Alternate translation: “Jesus healed her of the fever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
You may want to make explicit that she served food. Alternate translation: “she provided them with food and drinks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Here the words “him” and “he” refer to Jesus.
The word “all” is an exaggeration to emphasize the great number of people who came. Alternate translation: “many who were sick or possessed by demons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
The word “city” is a metonym for the people who lived in the city. Here the word “whole” is probably a generalization to emphasize that most people from the city gathered. Alternate translation: “Many people from that city gathered outside the door” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
Here the words “he” and “him” refer to Jesus.
Jesus takes time to pray in the midst of his time of healing people. He then goes to towns throughout Galilee to preach, heal, and cast out demons.
“a place where he could be alone”
Here “him” refers to Simon. Also, those with him include Andrew, James, John, and possibly other people.
The word “Everyone” is an exaggeration to emphasize the very many people who were looking for Jesus. Alternate translation: “Many people are looking for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
Here the words “he” and “I” refer to Jesus.
“We need to go to some other place.” Here Jesus uses the word “us” to refer to himself, along with Simon, Andrew, James, and John.
The words “throughout all” are an exaggeration used to emphasize that Jesus went to many locations during his ministry. Alternate translation: “He went to many places in Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
“A leper came to Jesus. He knelt down and was begging Jesus and said”
In the first phrase, the words “to make me clean” are understood because of the second phrase. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to make me clean, then you can make me clean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
“want” or “desire”
In biblical times, a person who had any of certain skin diseases was considered unclean until his skin had healed enough that he was no longer contagious. Alternate translation: “you can heal me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Here the word “moved” is an idiom meaning to feel emotion about another’s need. Alternate translation: “Having compassion for him, Jesus” or “Jesus felt compassion for the man, so he” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
It may be helpful to state what Jesus is willing to do. Alternate translation: “I am willing to make you clean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
The word “him” used here refers to the leper whom Jesus healed.
“Be sure to not say anything to anyone”
Jesus told the man to show himself to the priest so that the priest could look at his skin to see if his leprosy was really gone. The law of Moses required people to present themselves to the priest if they had been unclean but were no longer unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The word “yourself” here represents the skin of the leper. Alternate translation: “show your skin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
It is best to use the pronoun “them,” if possible, in your language. Possible meanings are 1) “a testimony to the priests” or 2) “a testimony to the people.”
The word “he” refers to the man Jesus healed.
Here “spread the news widely” is a metaphor for telling people in many places about what had happened. Alternate translation: “began to tell people in many places about what Jesus had done” (See: and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
The man spread the news so much that
This was the result of the man spreading the news so much. Here “openly” is a metaphor for “publicly.” Jesus could not enter the towns because many people would crowd around him. Alternate translation: “that Jesus could no longer enter a town publicly” or “that Jesus could no longer enter the towns in a way that many people would see him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“lonely places” or “places where no one lived”
The word “everywhere” is a hyperbole used to emphasize how very many places the people came from. Alternate translation: “from all over the region” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
# Mark 02 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Sinners”<br><br>When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins like stealing or sexual sins. When Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who believe that they are sinners can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Fasting and Feasting<br><br>People would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or were showing God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, like during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>The Jewish leaders used rhetorical questions to show that they were angry because of what Jesus said and did and that they did not believe that he was God’s Son ([Mark 2:7](../../mrk/02/07.md)). Jesus used them to show the Jewish leaders that they were arrogant ([Mark 2:25-26](./25.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br>
After preaching and healing people throughout Galilee, Jesus returns to Capernaum where he heals and forgives the sin of a paralyzed man.
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “the people there heard that he was staying at his home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
The word “there” refers to the house that Jesus stayed it in Capernaum. Alternate translation: “So many people gathered there” or “So many people came to the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This refers to there being no space inside the house. Alternate translation: “there was no more room for them inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“Jesus spoke his message to them”
“four of them were carrying him.” It is likely that there were more than four people within the group that brought the man to Jesus.
“were bringing a man who was unable to walk or use his arms”
“could not get close to where Jesus was”
Houses where Jesus lived had flat roofs made of clay and covered with tiles. The process of making a hole in the roof can be explained more clearly or made more general so that it may be understood in your language. Alternate translation: “they removed the tiles from the part of the roof above where Jesus was. And when they had dug through the clay roof, they lowered” or “they made a hole in the roof above where Jesus was, and then they lowered”
“Seeing the men’s faith.” Possible meanings are 1) that only the men who carried the paralyzed man had faith or 2) that the paralyzed man and the men who brought him to Jesus all had faith. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The word “Son” here shows Jesus cared for the man as a father cares for a son. Alternate translation: “My son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
If possible translate this in such a way that Jesus does not clearly say who forgives the man’s sins. Alternate translation: “your sins are gone” or “you do not have to pay for your sins” or “your sins do not count against you”
Here “their hearts” is a metonym for the people’s thoughts. Alternate translation: “were thinking to themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
The scribes used this question to show their anger that Jesus said “Your sins are forgiven.” Alternate translation: “This man should not speak this way!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The scribes used this question to say that since only God can forgive sins, then Jesus should not say “Your sins are forgiven.” Alternate translation: “Only God can forgive sins!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
“in his inner being” or “in himself”
Each of the scribes was thinking to himself; they were not talking to each other.
Jesus uses this question to tell the scribes that what they are thinking is wrong. Alternate translation: “What you are thinking is wrong.” or “Do not think that I am blaspheming.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The word “hearts” is a metonym for their inner thoughts and desires. Alternate translation: “this inside yourselves” or “these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
Jesus uses this question to make the scribes think about what might prove whether or not he could really forgive sins. Alternate translation: “I just said to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven.’ You may think that it is harder to say ‘Get up, take up your bed, and walk,’ because the proof of whether or not I can heal him will be shown by whether or not he gets up and walks.” or “You may think that it is easier to say to the paralyzed man ‘Your sins are forgiven’ than it is to say ‘Get up, take up your bed, and walk.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
“But so that you may know.” The word “you” refers to the scribes and the crowd.
Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man.” Alternate translation: “that I am the Son of Man and I have authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
“while all the people there were watching”
Jesus is teaching the crowd beside the Sea of Galilee, and he calls Levi to follow him.
This is the Sea of Galilee, which is also known as the Lake of Gennesaret.
“the people went where he was”
Alpheus was Levi’s father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
It is now later in the day, and Jesus is at Levi’s house for a meal.
“the home of Levi”
people who did not obey the law of Moses but committed what others thought were very bad sins
Possible meanings are 1) “for there were many tax collectors and sinful people who followed Jesus” or 2) “for Jesus had many disciples and they followed him.”
The scribes and Pharisees asked this question to show they disapproved of Jesus’ hospitality. This can be worded as a statement. Alternate translation: “He should not eat with sinners and tax collectors!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Jesus responds to what the scribes had said to his disciples about his eating with tax collectors and sinful people.
“he said to the scribes”
Jesus used this proverb about sick people and doctors to teach them that only people who know that they are sinful realize that they need Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
“healthy”
Jesus expects his hearers to understand he came for those who want help. Alternate translation: “I came for people who understand they are sinful, not for people who believe they are righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
The words “I came to call” are understood from the phrase before this. Alternate translation: “but I came to call sinners” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Jesus tells parables to show why his disciples should not fast while he is with them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
These two phrases refer to the same group of people, but the second is more specific. Both refer to the followers of the Pharisee sect, but they do not focus on the leaders of the Pharisees. Alternate translation: “the disciples of the Pharisees were fasting…the disciples of the Pharisees”
“Some men.” It is best to translate this phrase without specifying exactly who these men are. If in your language you have to be more specific, the possible meanings are 1) these men were not among John’s disciples or the disciples of the Pharisees or 2) these men were among John’s disciples.
“came and said to Jesus”
Jesus uses this question to remind the people of something they already know and to encourage them to apply it to him and his disciples. Alternate translation: “Wedding attendants do not fast while the bridegroom is with them. Rather they celebrate and feast.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “the bridegroom will go away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
The word “them” and “they” refer to the wedding attendants.
Sewing a piece of new cloth on an old garment will make the hole on an old garment worse if the piece of new cloth has not yet shrunk. Both the new cloth and old garment will be ruined. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Jesus begins to tell another parable. This one is about putting new wine into old wineskins rather than into new wineskins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
“grape juice.” This refers to wine that has not fermented yet. If grapes are unknown in your area, use the general term for fruit juice.
This refers to wineskins that have been used many times.
These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called “wine bags” or “skin bags.”
New wine expands as it ferments, so it would cause old, brittle wineskins to tear open.
“will be ruined”
“new wineskins” or “new wine bags.” This refers to wineskins that have never been used.
Jesus gives the Pharisees an example from scripture to show why the disciples were not wrong to pick grain on the Sabbath.
Plucking grain in others’ fields and eating it was not considered stealing. The question was whether it was lawful to do this on the Sabbath. The disciples picked the heads of grain to eat the kernels, or seeds, in them. This can be worded to show the full meaning. Alternate translation: “pick heads of grain and eat the seeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The “heads” are the topmost part of the wheat plant, which is a kind of tall grass. The heads hold the mature grain or seeds of the plant.
The Pharisees ask a question about what the disciples were doing (verse 23).
Plucking grain in others’ fields and eating it (verse 23) was not considered stealing. The question was whether it was lawful to do this on the Sabbath.
The Pharisees ask Jesus a question to condemn him. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “Look! They are breaking the Jewish law concerning the Sabbath.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
“Look at this” or “Listen.” This is a word used to get the attention of someone to show them something. If there is a word in your language that is used to draw a person’s attention to something, you could use that here.
Jesus begins to scold the Pharisees by asking them a question.
“Jesus said to the Pharisees”
Jesus asks this question to remind the scribes and Pharisees of something David did on the Sabbath. The question is very long, so it can be divided into two sentences. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This can be stated as a command. Alternate translation: “Remember what you read about what David did…him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Jesus refers to reading about David in the Old Testament. This can be translated showing the implicit information. Alternate translation: “read in the scriptures what David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Jesus finishes asking the question he began in verse 25.
This can be expressed as a statement separate from verse 25. Alternate translation: “He went into the house of God…to those who were with him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The word “he” refers to David.
This refers to the twelve loaves of bread that were placed on a golden table in the tabernacle or temple building as a sacrifice to God during Old Testament times.
Jesus makes clear why God established the Sabbath. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “God made the Sabbath for mankind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
“man” or “people” or “the needs of people.” This word here refers to both men and women. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
The words “was made” are understood from the previous phrase. They can be repeated here. Alternate translation: “mankind was not made for the Sabbath” or “God did not make mankind for the Sabbath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
# Mark 03 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sabbath<br>It was against the law of Moses to do work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees believed healing a sick person on the Sabbath was “work,” so they said that Jesus did wrong when he healed a person on the Sabbath. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”<br><br>No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>Thaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.<br><br>### Brothers and Sisters<br><br>Most people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])<br>
Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath in the synagogue and shows how he feels about what the Pharisees had done with the Sabbath rules. The Pharisees and Herodians begin to plan to put Jesus to death.
“a man with a crippled hand”
“Some people watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man with the withered hand”
“Some of the Pharisees.” Later, in [Mark 3:6](../03/06.md), these people are identified as Pharisees.
If Jesus were to heal the man that day, the Pharisees would accuse him breaking the law by the working on the Sabbath. Alternate translation: “so that they could accuse him of wrongdoing” or “so that they could accuse him of breaking the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“in the middle of this crowd”
Jesus said this to challenge them. He wanted them to acknowledge that it is lawful to heal people on the Sabbath. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
These two phrases are similar in meaning, except that the second is more extreme. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
It may be helpful to repeat “is it lawful,” as that is the question Jesus is asking again in another way. Alternate translation: “is it lawful to save a life or to kill” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
This refers to physical life and is a metonym for a person. Alternate translation: “someone from dying” or “someone’s life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
“But they refused to answer him”
“Jesus looked around”
“was deeply saddened”
This metaphor describes how the Pharisees were unwilling to have compassion on the man with the withered hand. Alternate translation: “because they were unwilling to have compassion on the man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“Reach out with your hand”
This can be stated with an active form. Alternate translation: “Jesus restored his hand” or “Jesus made his hand the way it was before” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
“began to make a plan”
This is the name of an informal political party that supported Herod Antipas.
“how they might kill Jesus”
A great crowd of people follows Jesus, and he heals many people.
This refers to the Sea of Galilee.
This is the region, previously known as Edom, which covered the southern half of the province of Judea.
This refers to the miracles Jesus was performing. Alternate translation: “the great miracles that Jesus was performing”
“came to where Jesus was”
Verse 9 tells what Jesus asked his disciples to do because of the large crowd of people around him. Verse 10 tells why such a large crowd was around Jesus. The information in these verses can be reordered to present the events in the order they happened, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
As the large crowd was pushing forward toward Jesus, he was in danger of being crushed by them. They would not crush him intentionally. It was just that there were so many people.
This tells why so many people were crowding around Jesus that he thought they might crush him. Alternate translation: “For, because Jesus had healed many people, everyone…to touch him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])
The word “many” refers to the large number of people Jesus had already healed. Alternate translation: “For he healed many people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
They did this because they believed that touching Jesus would make them well. This can be expressed clearly. Alternate translation: “all the sick people pushed forward eagerly trying to touch him so that they might be healed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“saw Jesus”
Here “they” refers to the unclean spirits. It is they who are causing the people they possess to do things. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “they caused the people they were possessing to fall down before him and to cry out to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The unclean spirits did not fall down before Jesus because they loved him or wanted to worship him. They fell down before him because they were afraid of him.
Jesus has power over unclean spirits because he is the “Son of God.”
This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
“Jesus strictly ordered the unclean spirits”
“not to reveal who he was”
Jesus chooses the men he wants to be his apostles.
“so that they would be with him and he would send them to proclaim the message”
The author begins to list the names of the twelve apostles. Simon is the first man listed.
The phrase “to whom” refers to both James son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Jesus called them this because they were like thunder. Alternate translation: “the name Boanerges, which means men who are like thunder” or “the name Boanerges, which means thunder men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
“who would betray Jesus” The word “who” refers to Judas Iscariot.
“Then Jesus went to the house where he was staying.”
The word “bread” represents food. Alternate translation: “Jesus and his disciples could not eat at all” or “they could not eat anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
Members of his family went to the house, so that they could take hold of him and force him to go home with them.
Possible meanings for the word “they” are 1) his relatives or 2) some people in the crowd.
Jesus’ family uses this idiom to describe how they think he is acting. Alternate translation: “crazy” or “insane” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
“By the power of Beelzebul, who is the ruler of the demons, Jesus drives out demons”
Jesus explains with a parable why it is foolish for people to think that Jesus is controlled by Satan. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
“Jesus called the people to come to him”
Jesus asked this rhetorical question in response to the scribes saying that he cast out demons by Beelzebul. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “Satan cannot cast out himself!” or “Satan does not go against his own evil spirits!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The word “kingdom” is a metonym for the people who live in the kingdom. Alternate translation: “If the people who live in a kingdom are divided against each other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
This phrase is a metaphor meaning that the people will no longer be united and they will fall. Alternate translation: “cannot endure” or “will fall”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
This is a metonym for the people who live in a house. Alternate translation: “family” or “household” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
The word “himself” is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to Satan, and it is also a metonym for his evil spirits. Alternate translation: “If Satan and his evil spirits were fighting one another” or “If Satan and his evil spirits have risen up against each other and are divided” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
This is a metaphor meaning he will fall and cannot endure. Alternate translation: “will cease to be united” or “cannot endure and has come to an end” or “will fall and has come to an end” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
to steal a person’s valuables and possessions
This indicates that the statement that follows is especially true and important.
“those who have been born of man.” This expression is used to emphasize peoples’ humanity. Alternate translation: “people”
speak
“the people were saying”
This is an idiom that means to be possessed by an unclean spirit. Alternate translation: “is possessed by an unclean spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
“Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came”
“They sent someone inside to tell him that they were outside and to have him come out to them”
“are asking for you”
Jesus uses this question to teach the people. Alternate translation: “I will tell you who are really my mother and brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
“those who do…they are”
This is a metaphor that means Jesus’ disciples belong to Jesus’ spiritual family. This is more important than belonging to his physical family. Alternate translation: “that person is like a brother, sister, or mother to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
# Mark 04 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Mark 4:3-10 forms one parable. The parable is explained in 4:14-23.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 4:12, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Parables<br><br>The parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people would easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. He also told the stories so that those who did not want to believe in him would not understand the truth.<br>
As Jesus taught from a boat at the seaside, he told them the parable of the soils. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
This is the Sea of Galilee.
“Pay attention! A farmer”
All of the seeds that the farmer sowed are spoken of here as if they are one seed. “his seeds”
“As he threw seed over the soil.” In different cultures people sow seeds differently. In this parable the seeds were sown by throwing the seeds over the land that was prepared for growing.
All of the seeds that the farmer sowed are spoken of here as if they are one seed. “some seeds…devoured them”
All of the seeds that the farmer sowed are spoken of here as if they are one seed. “Other seeds…they did not have…they sprang…they did not have”
“the seed that landed on the rocky soil began to grow quickly”
This refers to the loose dirt on the ground in which you can plant seeds.
This refers to the young plants. This may be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “it scorched the young plants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
“because the young plants had no roots, they dried up”
All of the seeds that the farmer sowed are spoken of here as if they are one seed. See how you translated this in [Mark 4:3](../04/03.md). “Other seeds…choked them…they did not produce”
The amount of grain produced by each plant is being compared to the single seed from which it grew. Ellipsis is used here to shorten the phrases but they can be written out. Alternate translation: “Some plants bore thirty times as much as the seed that the man had planted, some produced sixty times as much grain, and some produced a hundred times as much grain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
“30…60…100.” These may be written as numerals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase “has ears” here is a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey. Alternate translation: “Whoever is willing to listen, listen” or “Whoever is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, listen” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
This does not mean that Jesus was completely alone; rather, that the crowds were gone and Jesus was only with the twelve and some of his other close followers.
This can be stated in active form. “God has given you” or “I have given you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
“but to those who are not among you.” This refers to all the other people who were not among the twelve or Jesus’ other close followers.
It can be stated that Jesus gives the parables to the people. Alternate translation: “I have spoken everything in parables” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
It is assumed that Jesus is speaking about the people looking at what he shows them and hearing what he tells them. Alternate translation: “when they look at what I am doing…when they hear what I am saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Jesus speaks of people understanding what they see as actually seeing. Alternate translation: “they look and do not understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“turn to God.” Here “turn” is a metaphor for “repent.” Alternate translation: “they would repent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Jesus explains the parable of the soils to his followers and then tells them about using a lamp to show that hidden things will become known.
“Then Jesus said to his disciples”
Jesus used these questions to show how sad he was that his disciples could not understand his parable. Alternate translation: “If you cannot understand this parable, think about how hard it will be for you to understand all the other parables.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
“The farmer who sows his seed represents”
The “word” represents God’s message. Sowing the message represents teaching it. Alternate translation: “the one who teaches people God’s message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“Some people are like the seeds that fall beside road” or “Some people are like the path where some of the seeds fell”
“the path”
Here “it” refers to “the word” or “God’s message.”
“And some people are like the seeds.” Jesus begins to explain how some people are like the seeds that fell on the rocky soil. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This is a comparison to the young plants that have very shallow roots. This metaphor means that the people were first excited when they received the word, but they were not strongly devoted to it. Alternate translation: “And they are like the young plants that have no roots” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This is an exaggeration to emphasize how shallow the roots were. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
It may be helpful to explain that tribulation comes because people believed God’s message. Alternate translation: “tribulation or persecution comes because they believed God’s message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
In this parable, “stumble” means “stop believing God’s message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Jesus begins to explain how some people are like the seeds that fell among the thorns. Alternate translation: “And other people are like the seeds that were sown among the thorns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“the worries in this life” or “the concerns about this present life”
“the desires for riches”
As Jesus continues to talk about people who are like the seeds that fell among the thorns, he explains what the desires and worries do to the word in their lives. Alternate translation: “enter in and choke God’s message in their lives like thorns choke young plants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“the word does not produce a crop in them”
Jesus begins to explain how some people are like the seeds that were sown in good soil. Alternate translation: “like the seeds that were sown in the good soil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This refers to the grain that the plants produce. Alternate translation: “some produce thirty grains, some produce sixty grains, and some produce a hundred grains” or “some produce 30 times the grain that was sown, some produce 60 times the grain that was sown, and some produce 100 times the grain that was sown” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] or [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
“Jesus said to the crowd”
This question may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “You certainly do not bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under a bed!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: “For everything that is hidden will be made known, and everything that is secret will come out into to open” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
“there is nothing that is hidden…there is nothing that is secret” Both of the phrases have the same meaning. Jesus is emphasizing that everything that is secret will be made known. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase “ears to hear” here is a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Mark 4:9](../04/09.md). Alternate translation: “If anyone is willing to listen, listen” or “If anyone is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Mark 4:9](../04/09.md). Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, listen” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
“Jesus said to the crowd”
Possible meanings are 1) Jesus is talking about a literal measure and giving generously to others or 2) this is a metaphor in which Jesus speaks of “understanding” as if it were “measuring.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “God will measure that amount for you, and he will add it to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “to him God will give more…from him God will take away” or “God will give more to him…God will take away from him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
Jesus then tells the people parables to explain the kingdom of God, which he later explains to his disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
Jesus likens the kingdom of God to a farmer who sows his seed. Alternate translation: “like a farmer who sows his seed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
This is something that the man habitually does. Alternate translation: “He sleeps each night and gets up each day” or “He sleeps each night and gets up the next day”
“though the man does not know how the seed sprouts and grows”
the stalk or sprout
the head on the stalk or the part of the plant that holds the fruit
Here “the sickle” is a metonym that stands for the farmer or the people whom the farmer sends out to harvest the grain. Alternate translation: “he immediately goes into the field with a sickle to harvest the grain” or “he immediately sends people with sickles into the field to harvest the grain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
a curved blade or a sharp hook used to cut grain
Here the phrase “has come” is an idiom for the grain being ripe for harvest. Alternate translation: “because the grain is ready to be harvested” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
Jesus asked this question to cause his hearers to think about what the kingdom of God is. Alternate translation: “With this parable I can explain what the kingdom of God is like.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “when someone sows it” or “when someone plants it”
The mustard tree is described as causing its branches to grow large. Alternate translation: “with large branches” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
“Word” here is a synecdoche for “the message of God.” The word “them” refers to the crowds. Alternate translation: “he taught the message of God to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
“and if they were able to understand some, he kept telling them more”
This means that he was away from the crowds, but his disciples were still with him.
Here “everything” is an exaggeration. He explained all his parables. Alternate translation: “he explained all his parables” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
As Jesus and his disciples take a boat to escape the crowds of people, a great storm arises. His disciples are afraid when they see that even the wind and the sea obey Jesus.
“Jesus said to his disciples”
“the other side of the Sea of Galilee” or “the other side of the sea”
Here “arose” is an idiom for “began.” Alternate translation: “a violent windstorm began” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
It may be helpful to state that the boat was filling up with water. Alternate translation: “the boat was in danger of being filled with water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
This is at the very back of the boat. “the stern of the boat”
The word “they” refers to the disciples. Compare a similar idea in the next verse, verse 39, “He got up.” “He” refers to Jesus.
The disciples asked this question to convey their fear. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “you need to pay attention to what is happening; we are all about to die!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The word “we” includes the disciples and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
These two phrases are similar and used to emphasize what Jesus wanted the wind and the sea to do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
“a great stillness over the sea” or “a great calm over the sea”
“And Jesus said to his disciples”
Jesus asks these questions to make his disciples consider why they are afraid when he is with them. These questions can be written as statements. Alternate translation: “You should not be afraid. You need to have more faith.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The disciples ask this question in amazement at what Jesus did. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “This man is not like ordinary men; even the wind and the sea obey him!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
# Mark 05 General Notes<br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Talitha, koum”<br><br>The words “Talitha, koum” ([Mark 5:41](../../mrk/05/41.md)) are from the Aramaic language. Mark writes them the way they sound and then translates them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])<br>
After Jesus calms the great storm, he heals a man who has many demons, but the local people in Gerasa are not glad about his healing, and they beg Jesus to leave.
The word “They” refers to Jesus and his disciples.
This refers to the Sea of Galilee.
This name refers to the people who live in Gerasa. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
This is an idiom meaning that the man is “controlled” or “possessed” by the unclean spirit. Alternate translation: “controlled by an unclean spirit” or “that an unclean spirit possessed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

This can be written in active form. Alternate translation: “he shattered his shackles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
pieces of metal that people wrap around the arms and legs of prisoners and attach with chains to objects that do not move so the prisoners cannot move
The man was so strong that no one could subdue him. Alternate translation: “He was so strong that no one was strong enough to subdue him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“control him”
Often times when a person is possessed by a demon, the demon will cause the person to do self-destructive things, such as cutting himself.
When the man first saw Jesus, Jesus would have been getting out of the boat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This means that he knelt down before Jesus out of reverence and respect, not out of worship.
The information in these two verses may be reordered to present the events in the order that they happened, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
“The unclean spirit cried out”
The unclean spirit asks this question out of fear. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! There is no reason for you to interfere with me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Jesus has the power to torment unclean spirits.
This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

One spirit was speaking for many here. He spoke of them as if they were a legion, a Roman army unit of about 6,000 soldiers. Alternate translation: “And the spirit said to him, ‘Call us an army, for many of us are inside the man.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“the unclean spirits begged Jesus”
It may be helpful to state clearly what Jesus allowed them to do. Alternate translation: “Jesus allowed the unclean spirits to do what they asked permission to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
You can make this a separate sentence: “into the sea. There were about two thousand pigs, and they drowned in the sea”

It can be stated clearly that the men gave their report to the people who were in the city and countryside. Alternate translation: “to people in the city and in the countryside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
This was the name of the many demons that were in the man. See how you translated this in [Mark 5:9](../05/09.md).

After healing the demon-possessed man in region of the Gerasenes, Jesus and his disciples return across the lake to Capernaum where the one of the rulers of the synagogue asks Jesus to heal his daughter.
It may be helpful to add information to this phrase. Alternate translation: “the other side of the sea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
“on the seashore” or “on the shore”
This is the Sea of Galilee.
This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
“Laying on hands” refers to a prophet or teacher placing his hand on someone and imparting either healing or a blessing. In this case, Jarius is asking Jesus to heal his daughter.
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “and heal her and make her live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

These two clauses can be linked differently to show more clearly why Herod feared John. Alternate translation: “for Herod feared John because he knew” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])
“Herod knew that John was a righteous”
“Listening to John”
The author continues to give background information about Herod and the beheading of John the Baptist. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
Here the word “he” refers to Herod and is a metonym for his servant whom he would have commanded to prepare a meal. Alternate translation: “he had a dinner made for his officials…of Galilee” or “he invited his officials…of Galilee to eat and celebrate with him”

This refers to a place where there are no people. See how you translated this in [Mark 6:31](../06/31.md).
“But Jesus answered and said to his disciples”
The disciples ask this question to say that there is no way they could afford to buy enough food for this crowd. Alternate translation: “We could not buy enough bread to feed this crowd, even if we had two hundred denarii!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Ephphatha”<br><br>This is an Aramaic word.

Jesus rebukes the Pharisees and scribes.
“gathered around Jesus”
In verses 3 and 4, the author gives background information about the Pharisees’ washing traditions in order to show why the Pharisees were bothered that Jesus’ disciples did not wash their hands before eating. This information can be reordered in order to make it easier to understand, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
“The Pharisees and the scribes saw”
The word “unwashed” explains why the disciples’ hands were defiled. It can be expressed in active form. Alternate translation: “that is, with hands that they had not washed” or “that is, that they had not washed their hands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
Jewish elders were leaders in their communities and were also judges for the people.
“copper kettles” or “metal containers”
“Walk in” here is a metaphor for “obey.” The Pharisees and scribes asked this question to challenge Jesus’ authority. This can be written as two statements. Alternate translation: “Your disciples disobey the traditions of our elders! They should wash their hands using our rituals.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This is a synecdoche, representing food in general. Alternate translation: “food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
Here Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah, who had written scripture many years earlier.
Here “lips” is a metonym for speaking. Alternate translation: “by what they say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

“They offer me useless worship” or “They worship me in vain”
Jesus continues to rebuke the scribes and Pharisees.
refuse to obey
“hold strongly to” or “only keep”
Jesus uses this ironic statement to rebuke his listeners for forsaking God’s commandment. Alternate translation: “You think you have done well in how you have rejected the commandment of God so you may keep your own traditions, but what you have done is not good at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
“How skillfully you reject”
“who curses”
“must be put to death”
This may be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “The authorities must execute a person who speaks evil about his father or mother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
The tradition of the scribes said that once money or other things were promised to the temple, they could not be used for any other purpose.
“Corban” here is a Hebrew word that refers to things that people promise to give to God. Translators normally transliterate it using the target language alphabet. Some translators translate its meaning, and then leave out Mark’s explanation of the meaning that follows. Alternate translation: “is a gift to God” or “belongs to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
This phrase explains the meaning of the Hebrew word “Corban.” It can be stated in active form. Mark explained the meaning so that his non-Jewish readers could understand what Jesus said. Alternate translation: “I have given it to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
In verses 11 and 12, Jesus shows how the Pharisees teach people that they do not have to obey God’s commandment to honor their parents. In verse 11 Jesus tells what the Pharisees allow people to say about their possessions, and in verse 12 he tells how that shows the Pharisees’ attitude toward people helping their parents. This information can be reordered to first tell about the Pharisees’ attitude toward people helping their parents and then tell how that attitude is shown in what the Pharisees allow people to say about their possessions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
By doing this, the Pharisees are allowing people not to provide for their parents, if they promise to give to God what they would have given to them. You can order these words before the words that begin with “Whatever help” in verse 11: “You no longer permit a person to do anything for his father or his mother after he says, ‘Whatever help you would have received from me is Corban.’ (Corban means ‘Given to God.’)” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
canceled or done away with
“you are doing may other things similar to this”
Jesus tells a parable to the crowd to help them understand what he has been saying to the scribes and Pharisees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
“Jesus called”
The words “Listen” and “understand” are related. Jesus uses them together to emphasize that his hearers should pay close attention to what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
It may be helpful to state what Jesus is telling them to understand. Alternate translation: “try to understand what I am about to tell you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Jesus is speaking about what a person eats. This is in contrast to “what come out of the person.” Alternate translation: “nothing from outside a person that he can eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This refers to the things a person does or says. This is in contrast to “what is outside a person that enters into him.” Alternate translation: “It is what comes out of a person that he says or does” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The disciples still do not understand what Jesus has just said to the scribes, Pharisees, and crowds. Jesus explains his meaning more thoroughly to them.
This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Jesus is now away from the crowd, in a house with his disciples.
Jesus begins to teach his disciples by asking a question.
Jesus uses this question to express his disappointment that they do not understand. This can be expressed as a statement. Alternate translation: “After all I have said and done, I would expect you to understand.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Jesus finishes asking the question he is using to teach his disciples.
This is the end of the question that begins with the words “Do you not see” in verse 18. Jesus uses this question to teach his disciples something they should already know. It can be expressed as a statement. “You should already understand that whatever enters into a person from outside cannot defile him, because it cannot go into his heart, but it goes into his stomach and then passes out into the latrine.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Here “heart” is a metonym for a person’s inner being or mind. Here Jesus means that food does not affect a person’s character. Alternate translation: “it cannot go into his inner being” or “it cannot go into his mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
Here “it” refers to what goes into a person; that is, what a person eats.
It may be helpful to explain clearly what this phrase means. Alternate translation: “all foods clean, meaning that people can eat any food without God considering the eater defiled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“Jesus said”
“What defiles a person is what comes out of him”
Here “heart” is a metonym for a person’s inner being or mind. Alternate translation: “out of the inner being, come evil thoughts” or “out of the mind, come evil thoughts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
not controlling one’s lustful desires
Here the word “within” describes a person’s heart. Alternate translation: “come from within a person’s heart” or “come from within a person’s thoughts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
When Jesus goes away to Tyre, he heals the daughter of a Gentile woman who has extraordinary faith.
This is an idiom meaning that she was possessed by the unclean spirit. Alternate translation: “was possessed by an unclean spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
“knelt.” This is an act of honor and submission.
The word “Now” marks a break in the main story line, as this sentence gives us background information about the woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
This is the name of the woman’s nationality. She was born in the Phoenician region in Syria. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
Here Jesus speaks about the Jews as if they are children and the Gentiles as if they are dogs. Alternate translation: “Let the children of Israel first be fed. For it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the Gentiles, who are like dogs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “We must first feed the children of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
This refers to food in general. Alternate translation: “food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
This refers to small dogs kept as pets.
Jesus was implying that she no longer needed to stay to ask him to help her daughter. He would do it. Alternate translation: “you may go now” or “you may go home in peace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Jesus has caused the unclean spirit to leave the woman’s daughter. This can be expressed clearly. Alternate translation: “I have caused the evil spirit to leave your daughter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
After healing people in Tyre, Jesus goes to the Sea of Galilee. There he heals a deaf man, which amazes the people.
“left the region of Tyre”
Possible meanings are 1) “in the region” as Jesus is at the sea in the region of the Decapolis or 2) “through the region” as Jesus went through the region of the Decapolis to get to the sea.
This is the name of a region that means Ten Cities. It is located to the southeast of the Sea of Galilee. See how you translated this in [Mark 5:20](../05/20.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
“And people brought”
“who was not able to hear”
Prophets and teachers would put their hands on people in order to heal them or bless them. In this case, people are begging Jesus to heal a man. Alternate translation: “they begged Jesus to put his hand on the man to heal him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“Jesus took the man”
Jesus is putting his own fingers in the man’s ears.
Jesus spits and then touches the man’s tongue.
It may be helpful to state that Jesus spit on his fingers. Alternate translation: “after spitting on his fingers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This means that he looked up toward the sky, which is associated with the place where God lives.
Here the author refers to something by an Aramaic word. This word should be copied as is into your language using your alphabet. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
This means that he groaned or that he let out a long deep breath that could be heard. It probably shows Jesus’ sympathy for the man.
“said to the man”
This means he was able to hear. Alternate translation: “his ears were opened and he was able to hear” or “he was able to hear”
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “Jesus took away what prevented his tongue from speaking” or “Jesus loosened his tongue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
The refers to him ordering them not to tell anyone about what he had done. Alternate translation: “the more he ordered them not to tell anyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
“the more widely” or “the more”
“were utterly amazed” or “were exceedingly astonished” or “were astonished beyond all measure”
These refer to people. Alternate translation: “deaf people…mute people” or “people who cannot hear…people who cannot speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” ([Mark 8:35-37](./35.md)).<br>
A great, hungry crowd is with Jesus. He feeds them using only seven loaves and a few fish before Jesus and his disciples get in a boat to go to another place.
This phrase is used to introduce a new event in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
“this is this third day these people have been with me, and they have nothing to eat”
Possible meanings are 1) literal, “they may lose consciousness temporarily” or 2) hyperbolic exaggeration, “they may become weak.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
The disciples are expressing surprise that Jesus would expect them to be able to find enough food. Alternate translation: “This place is so deserted that there is no place here for us to get enough loaves of bread to satisfy these people!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Loaves of bread are lumps of dough that have been shaped and baked.
“Jesus asked his disciples”
This can be written as a direct quote. “Jesus commanded the crowd, ‘Sit down on the ground’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
Use your language’s word for how people customarily eat when there is no table, whether sitting or lying down.
Here the word “they” is used to refer to Jesus and his disciples.
“Jesus gave thanks for the fish”
“The people ate”
“the disciples picked up”
This refers to the broken pieces of fish and bread that were left over after the people ate. Alternate translation: “the remaining broken pieces of bread and fish, which filled seven large baskets” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
It may be helpful to clarify when he sent them away. Alternate translation: “After they ate, Jesus sent them away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
It may be helpful to clarify how they got to Dalmanutha. Alternate translation: “they sailed around the Sea of Galilee to the region of Dalmanutha” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This is the name of a place on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
In Dalmanutha, Jesus refuses to give the Pharisees a sign before he and his disciples get in a boat and leave.
“They asked him for”
They wanted a sign that would prove that Jesus’ power and authority were from God. Possible meanings are 1) The word “heaven” is a metonym for God. Alternate translation: “a sign from God” or 2) the word “heaven” refers to the sky. Alternate translation: “a sign from the sky” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
The Pharisees tried to test Jesus to make him prove that he was from God. Some information can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “to prove that God had sent him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This means that he groaned or that he let out a long deep breath that could be heard. It probably shows Jesus’ deep sadness that the Pharisees refused to believe him. See how you translated this in [Mark 7:34](../07/34.md).
“in himself”
Jesus is scolding them. This question may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “This generation should not seek a sign.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
When Jesus speaks of “this generation,” he is referring to the people who lived at that time. There Pharisees are included in this group. Alternate translation: “you and the people of this generation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “I will not give a sign” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
Jesus’ disciples went with him. Some information can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “he left them, got into a boat again with his disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This describes the Sea of Galilee, which can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “to the other side of the sea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
While Jesus and his disciples are in a boat, they have a discussion about the lack of understanding among the Pharisees and Herod, though they had seen many signs.
This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here the author tells background information about the disciples forgetting to bring bread. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
The negative phrase “no more” is used to emphasize how small an amount of bread they had. Alternate translation: “only one loaf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
These two terms have a common meaning and are repeated here for emphasis. They can be combined. Alternate translation: “Keep watch” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
Here Jesus is speaking to his disciples in a metaphor they do not understand. Jesus is comparing the Pharisees’ and Herod’s teachings to yeast, but you should not explain this when you translate it because the disciples themselves did not understand it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
In this statement, it may be helpful to state that “it” refers to what Jesus had said. Alternate translation: “He must have said that because we have no bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The word “no” is an exaggeration. The disciples did have one loaf of bread ([Mark 8:14](../08/14.md)), but that was not much different from having no bread at all. Alternate translation: “very little bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
Here Jesus is mildly rebuking his disciples because they should have understood what he had been talking about. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should not be thinking that I am talking about actual bread.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
These questions have the same meaning and are used together to emphasize that they do not understand. This can be written as one question or as a statement. Alternate translation: “Do you not yet understand?” or “You should perceive and understand by now the things I say and do.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Here “hearts” is a metonym for a person’s mind. The phrase “hearts become so dull” is a metaphor for not being able or willing to understand something. Jesus uses a question to scold the disciples. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “Your thinking has become so dull!” or “You are so slow to understand what I mean!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Jesus continues to mildly rebuke his disciples. These questions can be written as statements. Alternate translation: “You have eyes, but you do not understand what you see. You have ears, but you do not understand what you hear. You should remember.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This refers to the 5,000 people Jesus fed. Alternate translation: “the 5,000 people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
It may be helpful to state when they collected the baskets of pieces. Alternate translation: “how many baskets full of broken pieces of bread did you collect after everyone finished eating” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This refers to the 4,000 people Jesus fed. Alternate translation: “the 4,000 people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
It may be helpful to state when they collected these. Alternate translation: “how many baskets full of broken pieces of bread did you collect after everyone finished eating” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Jesus is mildly rebuking his disciples for not understanding. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should understand by now the things I say and do.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
When Jesus and his disciples get out of their boat at Bethsaida, Jesus heals a blind man.
This is a town on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. See how you translated the name of this town in [Mark 6:45](../06/45.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
It may be helpful to state why they wanted Jesus to touch the man. Alternate translation: “to touch him in order to heal him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“When Jesus had spit on the man’s eyes…Jesus asked the man”
“The man looked up”
The man sees men walking around, yet they are not clear to him, so he compares them to trees. Alternate translation: “Yes, I see people! They are walking around, but I cannot see them clearly. They look like trees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
“Then Jesus again”
The phrase “his sight was restored” can be written in active form. Alternate translation: “restoring the man’s sight, and then the man opened his eyes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
Jesus and his disciples talk on their way to the villages of Caesarea Philippi about who Jesus is and what will happen to him.
“They answered him, saying,”
The disciples answer that this was who some people said Jesus was. This can be shown more clearly. Alternate translation: “Some people say that you are John the Baptist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The word “others” refers to other people. This refers to their responses to Jesus’ question. Alternate translation: “Other people say you are…other people say you are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
“Jesus asked his disciples”
Jesus did not want them to tell anyone that he was the Christ. This can be made more explicit. Also, this can also be written as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “Jesus warned them not to tell anyone that he is the Christ” or “Jesus warned them, ‘Do not tell anyone that I am the Christ’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “that the elders and the chief priests and the scribes would reject him, and that men would kill him, and that after three days he would rise up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
“He said this in a way that was easy to understand”
Peter rebuked Jesus for saying the things he said would happen to the Son of Man. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “began to rebuke him for saying these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
After rebuking Peter for his not wanting Jesus to die and rise, Jesus tells both his disciples and the crowd how to follow him.
Jesus means that Peter is acting like Satan because Peter is trying to prevent Jesus from accomplishing what God sent him to do. Alternate translation: “Get behind me, because you are acting like Satan! You are not setting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“Get away from me”
Following Jesus here represents being one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “be my disciple” or “be one of my disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“must not give in to his own desires” or “must forsake his own desires”
“carry his cross and follow me.” The cross represents suffering and death. Taking up the cross represents being willing to suffer and die. Alternate translation: “must obey me even to the point of suffering and dying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Following Jesus here represents obeying him. Alternate translation: “obey me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“For anyone who wants”
This refers to both physical life and spiritual life.
“because of me and because of the gospel.” Jesus is talking about people who lose their lives because they follow Jesus and the gospel. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “because he follows me and tells others the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “Even if a person gains the whole world, it will not benefit him if he forfeits his life.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This can also be expressed as a condition starting with the word “if.” Alternate translation: “if he gains the whole world and then forfeits his life”
The words “the whole world” are an exaggeration for great riches. Alternate translation: “to gain everything he ever wanted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
To forfeit something is to lose it or to have another person take it away.
This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “There is nothing a person can give in exchange for his life.” or “No one can give anything in exchange for his life.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
If in your language “giving” requires someone to receive what is given, “God” can be stated as the receiver. Alternate translation: “What can a person give to God”
“ashamed of me and my message”
Jesus speaks of this generation as “adulterous,” meaning that they are unfaithful in their relationship with God. Alternate translation: “in this generation of people who have committed adultery against God and are very sinful” or “in this generation of people who are unfaithful to God and are very sinful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
“when he comes back”
When Jesus returns he will have the same glory as his Father.
“accompanied by the holy angels”
# Mark 09 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “transfigured”<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Mark says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Hyperbole<br><br>Jesus said things that he did not expect his followers to understand literally. When he said, “If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off” ([Mark 9:43](../../mrk/09/43.md)), he was exaggerating so they would know that they should stay away from anything that caused them to sin, even if it was something they loved or thought they needed.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Elijah and Moses<br><br>Elijah and Moses suddenly appear to Jesus, James, John, and Peter, and then they disappear.

Jesus has just been talking to the people and his disciples about following him. Six days later, Jesus goes with three of his disciples up a mountain where his appearance temporarily changes to what he will look like one day in the kingdom of God.
“Jesus said to his disciples”
The kingdom of God coming represents God showing himself as king. Alternate translation: “God show himself with great power as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
The author uses the reflexive pronoun “themselves” here to emphasize that they were alone and that only Jesus, Peter, James, and John went up the mountain. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
When they looked at him, his appearance was different from what it had been.
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “his appearance had changed” or “he appeared very different” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
“in front of them” or “so they could clearly him”
“shining” or “glowing.” Jesus’ garments were so white they were emitting or giving off light.
as much as possible or more than most
Bleaching describes the process of making natural white wool even whiter by using chemicals like bleach or ammonia. Alternate translation: “whiter than any person on earth could whiten them”
It may be helpful to state who these men are. Alternate translation: “two prophets who had lived long ago, Elijah and Moses, appeared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The word “they” refers to Elijah and Moses.
“Peter said to Jesus.” Here the word “answered” is used to introduce Peter into the conversation. Peter was not answering a question.
It is not clear whether “us” refers only to Peter, James, and John, or if it refers to everyone there, including Jesus, Elijah, and Moses. If you can translate so that both options are possible, do so. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
simple, temporary places in which to sit or sleep
This parenthetical sentence tells background information about Peter, James, and John. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
“they were very frightened” or “they were very afraid”
“appeared and covered”
Here “a voice came out” is a metonym for someone speaking. It can also be stated clearly who spoke. Alternate translation: “Then someone spoke from the cloud” or “Then God spoke from the cloud” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
God the Father expresses his love for his “beloved Son,” the Son of God.
This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
Here “they” refers to Peter, James, and John.
This implies that he was permitting them to tell people about what they had seen only after he rose from being dead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“risen from among the dead.” This speaks of becoming alive again. The phrase “the dead” refers to “dead people” and is a metonym for death. Alternate translation: “risen from death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
“to rise from among the dead.” This speaks of becoming alive again. The phrase “the dead” refers to “dead people” and is a metonym for death. Alternate translation: “rising from death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
Here “kept the matter to themselves” is an idiom that means they did not tell anyone about what they had seen. Alternate translation: “So they did not tell anyone about what they had seen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
Though Peter, James, and John wondered what Jesus might mean by “rising from the dead,” they asked him instead about Elijah’s coming.
The word “they” refers to Peter, James, and John.
Prophecy foretold that Elijah would come again from heaven. Then the Messiah, who is the Son of Man, would come to rule and reign. The disciples are confused about how the Son of Man could die and rise again. Alternate translation: “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first before the Messiah comes?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
By saying this, Jesus affirms that Elijah would come first.
Jesus uses this question to remind his disciples that the scriptures also teach that the Son of Man must suffer and be despised. This may be expressed as a statement. Alternate translation: “But I also want you to consider what is written about the Son of Man. The scriptures say that he must suffer many things and be hated.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This may be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “people would hate him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
It may be helpful to state what people did to Elijah. Alternate translation: “our leaders treated him very badly, just as they wanted to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
When Peter, James, John, and Jesus came down from the mountain, they found the scribes arguing with the other disciples.
Jesus, Peter, James, and John returned to the other disciples who had not gone with them up the mountain.
“Jesus and those three disciples saw a great crowd around the other disciples”
The scribes were arguing with the disciples who had not gone with Jesus.
It may be helpful to state why they were amazed. Alternate translation: “was amazed that Jesus had come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
To explain what the scribes and other disciples were arguing about, a father of a demon-possessed man tells Jesus that he has asked the disciples to send the demon out of his son, but they could not. Jesus then casts the demon out of the boy. Later the disciples ask why they were not able to send the demon away.
This means the boy is possessed by an unclean spirit. “He has an unclean spirit” or “He is possessed by an unclean spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
A convulsion, or seizure, can cause a person to have trouble breathing or swallowing. This causes white foam to come out of the mouth. If your language has a way to describe that, you could use it. Alternate translation: “bubbles come out of his mouth”
“he becomes stiff” or “his body becomes rigid”
This refers to the disciples not being about to drive the spirit out of the boy. Alternate translation: “they could not drive it out of him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Though it was the boy’s father who made a request of Jesus, Jesus responds to the whole crowd. This can be made clear. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to the crowd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“You unbelieving generation.” Jesus calls the crowd this, as he begins to respond to them.
Jesus uses these questions to express his frustration. Both questions have the same meaning. They can be written as statements. Alternate translation: “I have become weary by your unbelief!” or “Your unbelief tires me! I wonder how long I must bear with you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
“endure you” or “put up with you”
“Bring the boy to me”
This refers to the unclean spirit. See how you translated this in [Mark 9:17](../09/17.md).
This is a condition where a person has no control over his body, and his body shakes violently.
“Since he was a small child.” It may be helpful to state this as a full sentence. Alternate translation: “He has been like this since he was a small child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
“have compassion”
Jesus repeated what the man had said to him. Alternate translation: “Do you say to me ‘If you are able’?” or “Why do you say ‘If you are able’?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Jesus used this question to rebuke the man’s doubt. It can be expressed as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should not say to me, ‘If you are able.’” or “You ask me if I am able. Of course I am able.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
“God can do anything for people who believe in him”
“for the person” or “for anyone”
This refers to belief in God. Alternate translation: “believes in God”
The man is asking Jesus to help him overcome his unbelief and increase his faith. Alternate translation: “Help me when I do not believe” or “Help me have more faith”
This means that more people were running toward where Jesus was and that the crowd there was growing larger.
The words “mute” and “deaf” can be explained. Alternate translation: “You unclean spirit, you who are causing the boy to be unable to speak and unable to hear”
“The unclean spirit cried out”
“shook the boy violently”
It is implied that the spirit came out of the boy. Alternate translation: “came out of the boy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The boy’s appearance is compared to that of a dead person. Alternate translation: “The boy appeared dead” or “The boy looked like a dead person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
“so that many people”
This means that Jesus grasped the boy’s hand with his own hand. Alternate translation: “grasped the boy by the hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
“helped him get up”
This means they were alone.
“cast the unclean spirit out.” This refers to casting the spirit out of the boy. Alternate translation: “cast the unclean spirit out of the boy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
The words “cannot” and “except” are both negative words. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement. Alternate translation: “This kind can be cast out only by prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
This describes unclean spirits. Alternate translation: “This kind of unclean spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
After he heals the demon-possessed boy, Jesus and his disciples leave the house where they are staying. He takes time to teach his disciples alone.
“Jesus and his disciples left that region”
“traveled through” or “passed by”
Jesus was teaching his disciples privately, away from the crowd. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “for he was teaching his disciples privately” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: “Someone will deliver the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
Here Jesus refers to himself as the Son of Man. This is an important title for Jesus. “I, the Son of Man,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
Here “hands” is a metonym for control. Alternate translation: “into the control of men” or “so that men will be able to control him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

When they come to Capernaum, Jesus teaches his disciples about being humble servants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
“they arrived at.” The word “they” refers to Jesus and his disciples.
“were you discussing with one another”
They were silent because they were ashamed to tell Jesus what they had been discussing. Alternate translation: “they were silent because they were ashamed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Here “the greatest” refers to “the greatest” among the disciples. Alternate translation: “who was the greatest among them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Here the words “first” and “last” are opposites of one another. Jesus speaks of being the “most important” as being “first” and of being the “least important” as being “last.” Alternate translation: “If anyone wants God to consider him to be the most important person of all, he must consider himself to be the least important of all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“of all people…of all people”
“among them.” The word “their” refers to the crowd.

This means that he is not among their group of disciples. Alternate translation: “he is not one of us” or “he does not walk with us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
“is not opposing us”
It can be explained clearly what this means. Alternate translation: “is trying to achieve the same goals that we are”
Jesus speaks about giving someone a cup of water as an example of how one person may help another. This is a metaphor for helping someone in any way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This negative sentence emphasizes the positive meaning. In some languages, it is more natural to use a positive statement. Alternate translation: “definitely receive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
a large, round stone used for grinding grain into flour
Here “hand” is a metonym for desiring to do something sinful that you would do with your hand. Alternate translation: “If you want to do something sinful with one of your hands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
“to be maimed and then to enter into life” or “to be maimed before entering into life”

missing a body part as a result of having it removed or being injured. Here it refers to missing a hand. Alternate translation: “without a hand” or “missing a hand”
“where the fire cannot be put out”
Here the word “foot” is a metonym for desiring to do something sinful that you would do with your feet, such as going to a place you should not go to. Alternate translation: “If you want to do something sinful with one of your feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
“to be lame and then to enter into life” or “to be lame before entering into life”
Dying and then beginning to live eternally is spoken of as entering into life. Alternate translation: “to enter into eternal life” or “to die and begin to live forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“unable to walk easily.” Here it refers not being able to walk well because of missing a foot. Alternate translation: “without a foot” or “missing a foot”

This can be stated in the active form. Alternate translation: “for God to throw you into hell” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
The meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “where worms that eat people there do not die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “God will salt everyone with fire” or “Just as salt purifies a sacrifice, God will purify everyone by allowing them to suffer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
Here “fire” is a metaphor for suffering, and putting salt on people is a metaphor for purifying them. So “will be salted with fire” is a metaphor for being purified through suffering. Alternate translation: “will be made pure in the fire of suffering” or “will suffer in order to be purified as a sacrifice is purified with salt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“its salty taste”
This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “you cannot make it salty again.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
“taste salty again”
Jesus speaks of doing good things for one another as if good things were salt that people possess. Alternate translation: “Do good to each other, like salt adds flavor to food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
# Mark 10 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in 10:7-8.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Jesus’ teaching about divorce<br><br>The Pharisees wanted to find a way to make Jesus say that it is good to break the law of Moses, so they asked him about divorce. Jesus tells how God originally designed marriage to show that the Pharisees taught wrongly about divorce.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Metaphors are pictures of visible objects that speakers use to explain invisible truths. When Jesus spoke of “the cup which I will drink,” he was speaking of the pain he would suffer on the cross as if it were a bitter, poisonous liquid in a cup.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant” ([Mark 10:43](../../mrk/10/43.md)).<br>
After Jesus and his disciples leave Capernaum, Jesus reminds the Pharisees, as well as his disciples, what God really expects in marriage and divorce.
Jesus’ disciples were traveling with him. They were leaving Capernaum. Alternate translation: “Jesus and his disciples left Capernaum” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“and to the land on the other side of the Jordan River” or “and to the area east of the Jordan River”
The word “them” refers to the crowds.
“was his custom” or “he usually did”
Moses gave the law to their ancestors, which they now were also supposed to follow. Alternate translation: “What did Moses command your ancestors about this”
This was a paper saying that the woman was no longer his wife.
In some languages speakers do not interrupt a quote to say who is speaking. Rather they say who is speaking at the beginning or end of the complete quote. Alternate translation: “Jesus said to them, ‘It was because…this law.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
Long before this time, Moses wrote this law for the Jews and their descendants because they had hard hearts. The Jews of Jesus’ time also had hard hearts, so Jesus included them by using the words “your” and “you.” Alternate translation: “because your ancestors and you had hard hearts that he wrote this law”
Here “hearts” is a metonym for a person’s inner being or mind. The phrase “hard hearts” is a metaphor for “stubbornness.” Alternate translation: “your stubbornness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“God made people”
Jesus continues to quote what God said in the book of Genesis.

The word “this” refers to the conversation that Jesus had just had with the Pharisees about divorce.
“Anyone who”
Here “her” refers to the first woman he was married to.
In this situation she commits adultery again her previous husband. Alternate translation: “she commits adultery against him” or “she commits adultery against the first man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
When the disciples rebuke the people for bringing their little children to Jesus, he blesses the children and reminds the disciples that people must be as humble as a child to enter the kingdom of God.
“Now people were bringing.” This is the next event in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
This means that Jesus would touch them with his hands and bless them. Alternate translation: “he might touch them with his hands and bless them” or “he might lay his hands on them and bless them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“rebuked the people”
The word “it” refers to the disciples rebuking the people who were bringing the children to Jesus.
“became angry”
These two clauses have similar meanings, repeated for emphasis. In some languages it is more natural to emphasize this in another way. Alternate translation: “Be sure to allow the little children to come to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
This is a double negative. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement. Alternate translation: “allow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
The kingdom belonging to people represents the kingdom including them. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God includes people who are like them” or “because only people like them are members of the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“if anyone will not recieve…child, he will definitely not enter it”
Jesus is comparing how people must receive the kingdom of God to how little children would receive it. Alternate translation: “in the same manner as a child would” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
“will not accept God as their king”
The word “it” refers to the kingdom of God.
“he hugged the children”
Here the man speaks of “receiving” as if it were “inheriting.” This metaphor is used to emphasize the importance of receiving. Also, “inherit” here does not mean that someone has to die first. Alternate translation: to receive eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Jesus asks this question to remind the man that no man is good the way God is good. Alternate translation: “You do not understand what you are saying when you call me good.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
“good. Only God is good”
“do not testify falsely against anyone” or “do not lie about someone in court”
“There is one thing you are missing.” Here “lack” is a metaphor for needing to do something. Alternate translation: “One thing you need to do” or “There is one thing you have not yet done” or (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Here the word “it” refers to the things he sells and is a metonym for the money he receives when he sells them. Alternate translation: “give the money to the poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
This refers to poor people. Alternate translation: “poor people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
wealth, valuable things
“owned many things”
“It is very difficult”

“it is very hard”
Jesus uses an exaggeration to emphasize how very difficult it is for rich people to get into the kingdom of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
This speaks of an impossible situation. If you cannot state this in this way in your language, it can be written as a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “It would be easier for a camel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
“the hole of a needle.” This refers to the small hole in the end of a sewing needle that thread passes through.
“The disciples were”
This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “If that is so, then no one will be saved!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The understood information may be supplied. Alternate translation: “It is impossible for people to save themselves, but God can save them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Here the word “Look” is used to draw attention to the words that come next. Similar emphasis can be expressed in other ways. Alternate translation: “We have left everything and have followed you”
“have left everything behind”
“or plots of ground” or “or the land that he owns”
“for my cause” or “for me”
“to proclaim the gospel”
Jesus finishes a sentenc that begins with the words “there is no one who has left” (verse 29). The whole sentence can be stated positively. “everyone who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel, will receive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
“this life” or “this present age”
Like the list in verse 29, this describes the family in general. The word “fathers” is missing in verse 30, but it does not significantly change the meaning.
This can be reworded so that the ideas in the abstract noun “persecution” are expressed with the verb “persecute.” Because the sentence is so long and complicated, “will receive” can be repeated. Alternate translation: “and even though people persecute them, in the world to come, they will receive eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
“in the future world” or “in the future
Here the words “first” and “last” are opposites of one another. Jesus speaks of being the “important” as being “first” and of being the “unimportant” as being “last.” Alternate translation: “are important will be unimportant, and those who are unimportant will be important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
The phrase “the last” refers to people who are “last.” Also, the understood verb in this clause may be supplied. Alternate translation: “those who are last will be first” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
“Jesus and his disciples were walking on the road…and Jesus was in front of his disciples”
“those who were following behind them.” Some people were walking behind Jesus and his disciples.
“Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you”
Jesus is speaking about himself. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man, will” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

“You do not understand”
Here “cup” refers to what Jesus must suffer. Suffering is often referred to as drinking from a cup. Alternate translation: “drink the cup of suffering that I will drink” or “drink from the cup of suffering that I will drink from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Here “baptism” and being baptized represent suffering. Just as water covers a person during baptism, suffering will overwhelm Jesus. Alternate translation: “endure the baptism of suffering which I will suffer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
They respond this way, meaning that they are able to drink the same cup and endure the same baptism. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
“you will drink as well”
“But I am not the one who allows people to sit at my right hand or my left hand”
“but those places are for those for whom they have been prepared.” The word “it” refers to the places to his right hand and to his left hand.

Alternate translation: “those whom the Gentiles think of as their rulers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
have control or power over
“flaunt their authority.” This means that they show or use their authority in an overbearing way.

“be highly respected”
This is a metaphor for being the most important. Alternate translation: “to be the most important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Bartimaeus heard people saying that it was Jesus. Alternate translation: “When he heard people saying that it was Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Jesus is called the Son of David because he is a descendant of King David. Alternate translation: “You who are the Messiah descended from King David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

“even more”
This can be translated in active form or as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “commanded others to call him” or “commanded them, ‘Call him to come over here.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

This phrase is written this way to place emphasis on the man’s faith. Jesus heals the man because he believes that Jesus can heal him. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “I am healing you because you believed in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“he followed Jesus”
# Mark 11 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 11:9-10, 17, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The donkey and the colt<br><br>Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../../jhn/12/14.md))<br>

This means that they allowed them to continue doing what they were doing. Alternate translation: “let them take the donkey with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
“laid their cloaks on its back so Jesus could ride it.” It is easier to ride a colt or a horse when there is a blanket or something similar on its back. In this case, the disciples threw their cloaks on it.
“coats” or “robes”
It was a tradition to lay garments on the road in front of important people to honor them. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “Many people spread their garments on the road to honor him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

“the people who were buying and selling”
God had said earlier in his word, through the prophet Isaiah, that his temple would be a house of prayer for all the nations.
Jesus is rebuking the Jewish leaders for their misuse of the temple. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “It is written in the scriptures that God said, ‘I want my house to be called a house where people from all nations may pray.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

The next day when Jesus returns to temple, he gives the chief priests, scribes, and elders an answer to their question about his casting the money changers out of the temple area, by asking them another question, which they were not willing to answer.
“Jesus and his disciples came to”
This means that Jesus was walking around inside of the temple; he was not walking into the temple.
The word “They” refers to the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
Possible meanings: 1) Both of these questions have the same meaning and are asked together to strongly question Jesus’ authority and so can be combined. Alternate translation: “Who gave you authority to do these things?” 2) They are two separate questions, the first asking about the nature of the authority and the second about who gave it to him.

The author, Mark, explains why the religious leaders did not want to say that John’s baptism was from men. This can be stated clearly. “They said this to each other because they were afraid of the people” or “They did not want to say that John’s baptism was from men because they were afraid of the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

The word “them” here refers to the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders to whom Jesus had been talking in the previous chapter.
He put a barrier around the vineyard. It could have been a row of shrubs, a fence, or a stone wall.
This means that he carved a pit on the rock, which would be the bottom part of the winepress used for collecting the squeezed grape juice. Alternate translation: “carved a pit into rock for the winepress” or “he made a vat to collect the juice from the winepress” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The owner still owned the vineyard, but he allowed the vine growers to take care of it. When the grapes became ripe, they were to give some of them to the owner and keep the rest.
This refers to the time of harvest. This can be made clear. Alternate translation: “When the time came to harvest the grapes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“But the vine growers took the servant”
This means that they did not give him any of the fruit. Alternate translation: “without any grapes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“the owner of the vineyard sent to the vine growers”
This can be written more clearly. Alternate translation: “they beat that one on the head, and they hurt him terribly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
These phrases refer to other servants. Alternate translation: “yet another servant…many other servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
It is implied that this is the owner’s son. Alternate translation: “his beloved son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This is the owner’s heir, who would inherit the vineyard after his father died. Alternate translation: “the owner’s heir” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The tenants are referring to the vineyard as “the inheritance.” Alternate translation: “this vineyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
“The vine growers seized the son”
Jesus asks a question and then gives the answer to teach the people. The question may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “So I will tell you what the owner of the vineyard will do.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Jesus has finished telling the parable and is now asking the people what they think will happen next. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])
kill
The word “others” refers to other vine growers who will care for the vineyard. Alternate translation: “he will give the vineyard to vine growers to care for it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This scripture was written long before in God’s word.
Jesus reminds the people of a scripture passage. He uses a rhetorical question here to rebuke them. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “Surely you have read this scripture.” or “You should remember this scripture.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “the Lord made into the cornerstone”
“The Lord has done this”
Here “in our eyes” stands for seeing, which is a metaphor for the people’s opinion. Alternate translation: “we have seen it and think that it is marvelous” or “we think that it is wonderful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
“They” refers to the chief priests, scribes, and elders. This group may be referred to as the “Jewish leaders.”
“wanted”
They were afraid of what the crowd would do to them if they arrested Jesus. This can be made clear. Alternate translation: “but they feared what the crowd would do if they arrested him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“to accuse them”
In an effort to trap Jesus, some of the Pharisees and Herodians, and then the Sadducees, come to Jesus with questions.
“Then the Jewish leaders sent”
This was the name of an informal political party that supported Herod Antipas.
Here the author describes tricking Jesus as “trapping him.” Alternate translation: “to trick him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Here “they” refers to those sent from among the Pharisees and the Herodians.
This means that Jesus is not concerned. The negation can modify the verb instead. Alternate translation: “you do not care about people’s opinions” or “you are not concerned with earning people’s favor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
They were acting hypocritically. This can be explained more clearly. Alternate translation: “Jesus knew that they did not really want to know what God wanted them to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Jesus rebukes the Jewish leaders because they were trying to trick him. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “I know you are trying to make me say something wrong so you can accuse me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This coin was worth a day’s wages. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
“The Pharisees and the Herodians brought a denarius”
“picture and name”
Here “Caesar’s” refers to his likeness and inscription. Alternate translation: “They said, ‘They are Caesar’s likeness and inscription” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Jesus is teaching that his people must respect the government by paying taxes. This figure of speech can be clarified by changing Caesar to Roman government. Alternate translation: “Give to the Roman government the things that belong to the Roman government” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
The understood verb may be supplied. Alternate translation: “and give to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
They were amazed at what Jesus had said. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “They marveled at him and at what he had said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This phrase explains who the Sadducees were. This can be written more clearly. Alternate translation: “who say there is no resurrection from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The Sadducees are quoting what Moses had written in the law. Moses’ quote can be expressed as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
“wrote for us Jews.” The Sadducees were a group of Jews. Here they use the word “us” to refer to themselves and all Jews.
“the man should marry his brother’s wife”
“have a son for his brother.” The man’s first son would be considered to be the dead brother’s son, and the son’s descendants would be considered to be the dead brother’s descendants. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “have a son who will be considered to be the dead brother’s son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The Sadducees talk about a situation that did not really happen because they want Jesus to tell them what he thinks is right and wrong. Alternate translation: “Suppose there were seven brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
the first brother
“the first married a woman.” Here marrying a woman is spoken of as “taking” her.
These numbers refer to each of the brothers and can be expressed as such. Alternate translation: “the second brother…the third brother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
“the second married her.” Here marrying a woman is spoken of as “taking” her.
It may be helpful to explain what “likewise” means. Alternate translation: “the third brother married her as his other bothers did, and he also died leaving no children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This refers to all the brothers. Alternate translation: “The seven brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Each of the brothers married the woman and then died before he had any children with her. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “Eventually all seven brothers married that woman one by one, but none of them had any children with her, and one by one they died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
The Sadducees are testing Jesus by asking this question. If your readers can only understand this as a request for information, this can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “Now tell us whose wife she will be in the resurrection, when they all rise again.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Jesus rebukes the Sadducees because they are mistaken about God’s law. This may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “You are mistaken because…power of God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
This means that they do not understand what is written in the Old Testament scriptures.
“how powerful God is”
Here the word “they” refers to the brothers and the woman from the example.
Waking and getting up from sleep is a metaphor for becoming alive after having been dead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
From among all those who have died. This expression describes all dead people together in the underworld. To rise from among them speaks of becoming alive again.
“they do not marry, and they are not given in marriage”
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “and no one gives them in marriage” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
This refers to the place where God lives.
This can be expressed with an active verb. Alternate translation: “who rise” or “who rise to live again” [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
“the book that Moses wrote”
This refers to the part of the Book of Moses that tells about when God spoke to Moses out of a bush that was burning but that did not burn up. Alternate translation: “the passage about the burning bush” or “the words about the fiery bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
This refers to a shrub, a woody plant that is smaller than a tree.
“about when God spoke to Moses”
This means that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob worship God. These men have died physically, but they are still alive spiritually and still worship God.
Here “the dead” refers to people who are dead, and “the living” refers to people who are alive. Also, the words “the God” can be stated clearly in the second phrase. Alternate translation: “not the God of dead people, but the God of living people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
This includes people who are alive physically and spiritually.
It may be helpful to state what they are mistaken about. Alternate translation: “When you say that dead people do not rise again, you are quite mistaken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
“completely mistaken” or “very wrong”
“The scribe asked Jesus”
“The most important” refers to the most important commandment. Alternate translation: “The most important commandment is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
“Listen, O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord”
Here “heart” and “soul” are metonyms for a person’s inner being. These four phrases are used together to mean “completely” or “earnestly.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
Jesus uses this simile to compare how people are to love each other with the same love as they love themselves. Alternate translation: “love your neighbor as much as you love yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
Here the word “these” refers to the two commandments that Jesus had just told the people.
“Good answer, Teacher” or “Well said, Teacher”
This means that there is only one God. Alternate translation: “there is only one God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
The word “God” is understood from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “that there is no other God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Here “heart” is a metonym for person’s thoughts, feelings, or inner being. These three phrases are used together to mean “completely” or “earnestly.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
This simile compares how people are to love each other with the same love that they love themselves. Alternate translation: “to love your neighbor as much as you love yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
This idiom means that something is more important than something else. In this case, these two commandments are more pleasing to God that burnt offering and sacrifices. This may be written clearly. Alternate translation: “is even more important than” or “is even more pleasing to God than” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
This can be stated in positive form. Here Jesus speaks of the man being ready to submit to God as king as being physically close to the kingdom of God, as if it where a physical place. Alternate translation: “You are close to submitting to God as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: “everyone was afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
Some time has passed and Jesus is now in the temple. This is not part of the previous conversation. Alternate translation: “Later, while Jesus was teaching in the temple area, he said to the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Jesus uses this question to get the people to think deeply about the Psalm he is about to quote. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “Consider why the scribes say the Christ is the son of David.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
“a descendant of David”
This word “himself” refers to David and is used to place emphasis on him and what he said. Alternate translation: “It was David who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
This means that he was inspired by the Holy Spirit. That is, the Holy Spirit directed David in what he said. Alternate translation: “inspired by the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
Here David calls God “The Lord” and calls the Christ “my Lord.” This can be written more clearly. Alternate translation: “said about the Christ, ‘The Lord God said to my Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Jesus is quoting a psalm. Here God is speaking to the Christ. To sit at the “right hand of God” is a symbolic action of receiving great honor and authority from God. Alternate translation: “Sit in the place of honor beside me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
In this quote, God speaks of defeating enemies as making them into a footstool. Alternate translation: “until I completely defeat your enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Here the word “him” refers to the Christ.
This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “so consider how the Christ can be a descendant of David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
The noun “greetings” can be expressed with the verb “greet.” These greetings showed that the people respected the scribes. Alternate translation: “to be greeted respectfully in the marketplaces” or “people to greet them respectfully in the marketplaces” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Here Jesus describes the scribes’ cheating of widows and stealing of their houses as “devouring” their houses. Alternate translation: “They also cheat widows in order to steal their houses from them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
The words “widows” and “houses” are synecdoches for helpless people and all of a person’s important possessions, respectively. Alternate translation: “everything from helpless people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “God will certainly punish them with greater condemnation” or “God will certainly punish them severely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
The word “greater” implies a comparison. Here the comparison is to other men who are punished. Alternate translation: “will receive greater condemnation than other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
Still in the temple area, Jesus comments on the value of the widow’s offering.
This box, which everyone could use, held temple offerings.
“two small copper coins.” These were the least valuable coins available. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
“worth very little.” A penny is worth very little. Translate “penny” with the name of the smallest coin in your language if you have one that is worth very little.
In verse 43 Jesus says that the widow put more money in the offering than the rich people put in, and in verse 44 he tells his reason for saying that. The information can be reordered so that Jesus tells his reason first and then says that the widow put in more, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
“Jesus called”
This indicates that the statement that follows is especially true and important. See how you translated this in [Mark 3:28](../03/28.md).
“all the other people who put money into”
much wealth, many valuable things
“lack” or “the little she had”
“to survive on”
# Mark 13 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:24-25, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The return of Christ<br><br>Jesus said much about what would happen before he returned ([Mark 13:6-37](./06.md)).

Here “heaven” refers to the place where God lives.
It is best to translate “Father” with the same word that your language naturally uses to refer to a human father. Also, this is an ellipsis, stating that the Father knows when the Son will return. Alternate translation: “but only the Father knows” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
It can be stated clearly what “time” refers to here. Alternate translation: “when all these events will happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

“He is one of the twelve of you, the one now”
In Jesus’ culture, people would often eat bread, dipping it in a shared bowl of sauce or of oil mixed with herbs.
Here Jesus refers to the scriptures prophesying about his death. If you have a polite way to talk about death in your language, use it here. Alternate translation: “For the Son of Man will die in the way that the scriptures say”

When the chief priests, the elders, the scribes, and the council gave Jesus over to Pilate, they accused Jesus of doing many bad things. When Pilate asked if what they said was true, Jesus did not answer him.
They commanded for Jesus to be bound, but it would have been the guards who actually bound him and led him away.

They requested Barabbas to be released instead of Jesus. Alternate translation: “released instead of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
The crowd asks for Jesus’ death, so Pilate turns him over to the soldiers, who mock him, crown him with thorns, strike him, and lead him out to crucify him.
Pilate asks what he should do with Jesus if he releases Barabbas to them. This can be written clearly. Alternate translation: “If I release Barabbas, what then should I do with the King of the Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Mark 16 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### A young man dressed in a white robe<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/12.md))<br>

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “someone had rolled away the stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
The angel is emphatically stating that Jesus has risen from the dead. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: “He arose!” or “God raised him from the dead!” or “He raised himself from the dead!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
