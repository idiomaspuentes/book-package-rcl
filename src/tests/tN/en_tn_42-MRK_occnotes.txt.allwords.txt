what
is
the
book
of
mark
about
the
gospel
of
mark
is
one
of
four
books
in
the
new
testament
that
describe
some
of
the
life
of
jesus
christ
the
authors
of
the
gospels
wrote
about
different
aspects
of
who
jesus
was
and
what
he
did
mark
wrote
much
about
how
jesus
suffered
and
died
on
the
cross
he
did
this
to
encourage
his
readers
who
were
being
persecuted
mark
also
explained
jewish
customs
and
some
aramaic
words
this
may
indicate
that
mark
expected
most
of
his
first
readers
to
be
gentiles
how
should
the
title
of
this
book
be
translated
translators
may
choose
to
call
this
book
by
its
traditional
title
the
gospel
of
mark
or
the
gospel
according
to
mark
they
may
also
choose
a
title
that
may
be
clearer
such
as
the
good
news
about
jesus
that
mark
wrote
see
who
wrote
the
book
of
mark
the
book
does
not
give
the
name
of
the
author
however
since
early
christian
times
most
christians
have
thought
that
the
author
was
mark
mark
was
also
known
as
john
mark
he
was
a
close
friend
of
peter
mark
may
not
have
witnessed
what
jesus
said
and
did
but
many
scholars
think
that
mark
wrote
in
his
gospel
what
peter
told
him
about
jesus
part
2
important
religious
and
cultural
concepts
what
were
jesus
teaching
methods
the
people
regarded
jesus
as
a
rabbi
a
rabbi
is
a
teacher
of
gods
law
jesus
taught
in
similar
ways
as
other
religious
teachers
in
israel
he
had
students
who
followed
him
wherever
he
went
these
students
were
called
disciples
he
often
told
parables
parables
are
stories
that
teach
moral
lessons
see
and
and
part
3
important
translation
issues
what
are
the
synoptic
gospels
the
gospels
of
matthew
mark
and
luke
are
called
the
synoptic
gospels
because
they
have
many
similar
passages
the
word
synoptic
means
to
see
together
the
texts
are
considered
parallel
when
they
are
the
same
or
almost
the
same
among
two
or
three
gospels
when
translating
parallel
passages
translators
should
use
the
same
wording
and
make
them
as
similar
as
possible
why
does
jesus
refer
to
himself
as
the
son
of
man
in
the
gospels
jesus
calls
himself
the
son
of
man
it
is
a
reference
to
daniel
7colon13dash14
in
this
passage
there
is
a
person
described
as
a
son
of
man
that
means
the
person
was
someone
who
looked
like
a
human
being
god
gave
authority
to
the
son
of
man
to
rule
over
the
nations
forever
and
all
the
people
will
worship
him
forever
jews
of
jesus
time
did
not
use
son
of
man
as
a
title
for
anyone
therefore
jesus
used
it
for
himself
to
help
them
understand
who
he
truly
was
see
translating
the
title
son
of
man
can
be
difficult
in
many
languages
readers
may
misunderstand
a
literal
translation
translators
can
consider
alternatives
such
as
the
human
one
it
may
also
be
helpful
to
include
a
footnote
to
explain
the
title
why
does
mark
frequently
use
terms
indicating
short
periods
of
time
the
gospel
of
mark
uses
the
word
immediately
fortytwo
times
mark
does
this
to
make
the
events
more
exciting
and
vivid
it
moves
the
reader
quickly
from
one
event
to
the
next
what
are
the
major
issues
in
the
text
of
the
book
of
mark
the
following
verses
are
found
in
older
versions
of
the
bible
but
are
not
included
in
most
modern
versions
translators
are
advised
not
to
include
these
verses
however
if
in
the
translators
region
there
are
older
versions
of
the
bible
that
include
one
or
more
of
these
verses
the
translators
can
include
them
if
they
are
included
they
should
be
put
inside
square
brackets
to
indicate
that
they
were
probably
not
original
to
marks
gospel
if
any
man
has
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear

where
their
worm
never
dies
and
the
fire
is
never
quenched
9colon44
where
their
worm
never
dies
and
the
fire
is
never
quenched
9colon46
and
the
scripture
was
fulfilled
that
says
he
was
counted
with
the
lawless
ones
15colon28
the
following
passage
in
not
found
in
the
earliest
manuscripts
most
bibles
include
this
passage
but
modern
bibles
put
it
in
brackets
or
indicate
in
some
way
that
this
passage
may
not
have
been
original
to
marks
gospel
translators
are
advised
to
do
something
similar
as
the
modern
versions
of
the
bible
early
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
after
he
arose
he
appeared
first
to
mary
magdalene
from
whom
he
had
cast
out
seven
demons
she
went
and
told
those
who
were
with
him
while
they
were
mourning
and
weeping
they
heard
that
he
was
alive
and
that
he
had
been
seen
by
her
but
they
did
not
believe
after
these
things
he
appeared
in
a
different
form
to
two
of
them
as
they
were
walking
out
into
the
country
they
went
and
told
the
rest
of
the
disciples
but
they
did
not
believe
them
jesus
later
appeared
to
the
eleven
as
they
were
reclining
at
the
table
and
he
rebuked
them
for
their
unbelief
and
hardness
of
heart
because
they
did
not
believe
those
who
saw
him
after
he
rose
from
the
dead
he
said
to
them
go
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
the
entire
creation
he
who
believes
and
is
baptized
will
be
saved
and
he
who
does
not
believe
will
be
condemned
these
signs
will
go
with
those
who
believe
in
my
name
they
will
cast
out
demons
they
will
speak
in
new
languages
they
will
pick
up
snakes
with
their
hands
and
if
they
drink
anything
deadly
it
will
not
hurt
them
they
will
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
will
get
well
after
the
lord
had
spoken
to
them
he
was
taken
up
into
heaven
and
sat
down
at
the
right
hand
of
god
the
disciples
left
and
preached
everywhere
while
the
lord
worked
with
them
and
confirmed
the
word
by
the
signs
that
went
with
them

notes
structure
and
formatting
some
translations
set
each
line
of
poetry
farther
to
the
right
than
the
rest
of
the
text
to
make
it
easier
to
read
the
ult
does
this
with
the
poetry
in
1colon2dash3
which
are
words
from
the
old
testament
special
concepts
in
this
chapter
you
can
make
me
clean
leprosy
was
a
disease
of
the
skin
that
made
a
person
unclean
and
unable
to
properly
worship
god
jesus
is
capable
of
making
people
physically
clean
or
healthy
as
well
as
spiritually
clean
or
right
with
god
see
the
kingdom
of
god
is
near
scholars
debate
whether
the
kingdom
of
god
was
present
at
this
time
or
is
something
that
is
still
coming
english
translations
frequently
use
the
phrase
at
hand
but
this
can
create
difficulty
for
translators
other
versions
use
the
phase
is
coming
and
has
come
near
the
book
of
mark
begins
with
the
prophet
isaiahs
foretelling
of
the
coming
of
john
the
baptist
who
baptizes
jesus
the
author
is
mark
also
called
john
mark
who
is
the
son
of
one
of
the
several
women
named
mary
mentioned
in
the
four
gospels
he
is
also
the
nephew
of
barnabas
this
is
an
important
title
for
jesus
see
this
is
an
idiom
that
means
ahead
of
you
see
here
the
word
your
refers
to
jesus
and
is
singular
when
you
translate
this
use
the
pronoun
your
because
this
is
a
quote
from
a
prophet
and
he
did
not
use
jesus
name
see
this
refers
to
the
messenger
doing
this
represents
preparing
the
people
for
the
lords
arrival
alternate
translation
will
prepare
the
people
for
your
arrival
see
this
can
be
expressed
as
a
sentence
alternate
translation
the
voice
of
one
calling
out
in
the
wilderness
is
heard
or
they
hear
the
sound
of
someone
calling
out
in
the
wilderness
these
two
phrases
mean
the
same
thing
see
get
the
road
ready
for
the
lord
doing
this
represents
being
prepared
to
hear
the
lords
message
when
he
comes
people
do
this
by
repenting
of
their
sins
alternate
translation
prepare
to
hear
the
lords
message
when
he
comes
or
repent
and
be
ready
for
the
lord
to
come
see
and
in
these
verses
the
words
he
him
and
his
refer
to
john
be
sure
your
reader
understands
that
john
was
the
messenger
spoken
of
by
the
prophet
isaiah
in
the
previous
verse
the
words
whole
country
are
a
metaphor
for
the
people
who
live
in
the
country
and
a
generalization
that
refers
to
a
great
number
of
people
not
to
every
single
person
alternate
translation
many
people
from
judea
and
jerusalem
see
and
they
did
these
things
at
the
same
time
the
people
were
baptized
because
they
repented
of
their
sins
alternate
translation
when
they
repented
of
their
sins
john
baptized
them
in
the
jordan
river
see
john
proclaimed
john
is
comparing
himself
to
a
servant
to
show
how
great
jesus
is
alternate
translation
i
am
not
even
worthy
to
do
the
lowly
task
of
removing
his
shoes
see
at
the
time
jesus
was
on
earth
people
often
wore
sandals
that
were
made
of
leather
and
tied
to
their
feet
with
leather
straps
bend
down
this
metaphor
compares
johns
baptism
with
water
to
the
future
baptism
with
the
holy
spirit
this
means
johns
baptism
only
symbolically
cleanses
people
of
their
sins
the
baptism
by
the
holy
spirit
will
truly
cleanse
people
of
their
sins
if
possible
use
the
same
word
for
baptize
here
as
you
used
for
johns
baptism
to
keep
the
comparison
between
the
two
see
this
marks
the
beginning
of
a
new
event
in
the
story

this
can
be
stated
in
active
form
alternate

john
baptized
him
see
possible
meanings
are
1
this
is
a
simile
and
the
spirit
descended
upon
jesus
as
a
bird
descends
from
the
sky
toward
the
ground
or
2
the
spirit
literally
looked
like
a
dove
as
he
descended
upon
jesus
see
this
represents
god
speaking
sometimes
people
avoid
referring
directly
to
god
because
they
respect
him
alternate

god
spoke
from
the
heavens

and
this
is
an
important
title
for
jesus

his
beloved
son
because
of
his
eternal
love
for
him
see
after
jesus

almost
time
for
god
to
begin

so
others
will
also
follow
jesus
alternate
translation
i
will
teach
you
to
gather

it
can
be
assumed
that
this
boat
belongs
to
james
and
john
alternate
translation
in
their
boat
see
repairing
the
nets
it
may
be
helpful
to
state
clearly
why
jesus
called
to
james
and
john
alternate

called
them
to
come
with
him
see
servants
who
worked
for
them
james

teaches
in
the
synagogue

amazes
the
people
in
all
the
nearby
area
around
galilee
arrived
at

the
idea
of
teach
can
be
stated
clearly
when
talking
about
someone
who
has
authority

he
was
teaching
them
as
someone
who
has

the
demons
ask
this
rhetorical
question

jesus
to
interfere
with
them

they
desire
him
to
leave
them

harm
them

not
destroy
us

here
the
word
him
refers
to
the
demonpossessed
man

crying
out

be
expressed
as
exclamations

is
amazing
he
gives
a
new
teaching

the
word
he
refers
to
jesus
after
healing
the
demonpossessed
man
jesus
healed
simons
motherinlaw

many
other
people

the
great
number
of
people
who
came
alternate
translation
many
who
were
sick
or
possessed
by
demons
see
the
word
city
is
a
metonym
for
the
people
who
lived

probably
a
generalization

to
simon
also
those
with
him
include
andrew
james

here
jesus
uses
the
word
us
to
refer
to
himself
along
with
simon
andrew
james
and
john
the
words
throughout
all

an
exaggeration
used
to

that
jesus
went
to
many
locations
during
his
ministry
alternate
translation
he
went
to
many
places
in
galilee
see
a
leper

to
jesus
he
knelt
down
and
was
begging
jesus
and
said
in
the
first
phrase
the
words
to
make
me
clean

understood
because
of
the
second
phrase
alternate

if
you
are
willing
to
make
me
clean

had
any
of
certain
skin
diseases

considered
unclean
until
his
skin
had
healed
enough
that
he
was
no
longer
contagious
alternate
translation
you
can
heal
me
see
here
the
word
moved
is
an
idiom
meaning
to
feel
emotion
about
anothers
need
alternate
translation
having
compassion
for
him
jesus
or
jesus
felt
compassion
for
the
man
so
he
see
it
may
be
helpful
to
state
what
jesus
is
willing
to
do
alternate
translation
i
am
willing
to
make
you
clean
see
the
word
him
used
here

anything

sinners
when

spoke
of
sinners
they
were
talking
about
people
who
did
not
obey
the
law
of
moses
and
instead
committed
sins
like
stealing
or
sexual
sins
when
jesus
said
that
he
came
to
call
sinners
he
meant
that
only
people
who
believe
that
they
are
sinners
can
be
his
followers
this
is
true
even
if
they
are
not
what
most
people
think
of
as
sinners
see
fasting
and
feasting
people
would
fast
or
not
eat
food
for
a

when
they
were
sad
or
were
showing

that
they
were
sorry

the

angry
because
of
what
jesus
said

that
they

was
gods

jesus
used
them
to

jesus
returns

the

so
that
you

god
will
certainly
punish
them
with
greater
condemnation
or
god
will

44
he
tells

actual
room
cut
into
a
rock
it
had
a
flat
place
on
one
side
where
they
could
place
the
body
after
they
had
put
oil
and
spices
on
it
and
wrapped
it
in
cloth
then
they
would
roll
a
large
rock
in
front
of
the
tomb
so
no
one
could
see
inside
or
enter

difficulties
in
this
chapter
a
young
man
dressed
in
a
white
robe
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
all
wrote
about
angels
in
white
clothing
with
the
women
at
jesus
tomb
two
of
the
authors
called
them
men
but
that
is
only
because
the
angels
were
in
human
form
two
of
the
authors
wrote
about
two
angels
but
the
other
two
authors
wrote
about
only
one
of
them
it
is
best
to
translate
each
of
these
passages
as
it
appears
in
the
ult
without
trying
to
make
the
passages
all
say
exactly
the
same
thing
see
and
and
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
women
come
early
because
they
expect
to
use
spices
to
anoint
jesus
body
they
are
surprised
to
see
a
young
man
who
tells
them
jesus
is
alive
but
they
are
afraid
and
do
not
tell
anyone
that
is
after
the
sabbath
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
had
ended
and
the
first
day
of
the
week
had
begun
this
can
be
stated
in
active
form
alternate
translation
someone
had
rolled
away
the
stone
see
the
angel
is
emphatically
stating
that
jesus
has
risen
from
the
dead
this
can
be
translated
in
active
form
alternate
translation
he
arose
or
god
raised
him
from
the
dead
or
he
raised
himself
from
the
dead
