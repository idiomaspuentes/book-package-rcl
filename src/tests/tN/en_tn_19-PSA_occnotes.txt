# Psalm 001 General Notes<br>## Type of psalm<br><br>Psalm 1 is usually considered to be a “wisdom psalm,” which gives advice to those who hear it read or sung. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Blessed<br>A main theme in this psalm is what it means to be blessed. Here “blessed” refers to anyone who is well off because of a good relationship to God. The contrasting theme is that there are ungodly people, those who refuse to honor God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])<br><br>### People who opposed Yahweh<br><br>There are several words in this psalm for those who oppose God: “the wicked” (those who do evil), “sinners” (those who ignore God’s law), and “mockers” (those who mock God and the righteous people). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br>
Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
The “advice of the wicked” is spoken of as if it were a path to follow. Alternate translation: “who does not follow the advice of the wicked” or “who does not do what wicked people advise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Here the word “pathway” represents the way people live. The word “stand” is in parallel with “walk.” Alternate translation: “imitate the behavior of sinful people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
Sitting with people who mock God represents joining people who mock God. Alternate translation: “or join those who mock God” or “or mock God with others who mock him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
The word “delight” is an abstract noun that can be stated as a verb. A person who can “delight…in the law” is happy because the law is good and because one is obeying it. Alternate translation: “what makes him truly happy is the law of Yahweh” or “what makes him truly happy is to know that he is obeying the law of Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
This passage introduces an elaborate image in which a righteous person is thought of in terms of a flourishing tree.
In the Bible, people are often spoken of as trees. People who delight in Yahweh’s law can do all God wants them to do just as a tree that is planted by water produces good fruit. Alternate translation: “He will be prosperous like a tree…fruit in its season” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
A tree that is planted by a stream can get enough water to be healthy.
Healthy trees produce good fruit at the right time.
If a tree gets enough water, its leaves do not dry out and die.
“He will be successful at whatever he does”
How they are not like that can be stated clearly. “The wicked are not prosperous” or “The wicked do not prosper” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
How they are like chaff can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “but instead they are worthless like the chaff” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
Possible meanings are 1) not standing in the judgment is a metonym for being judged by God and having to leave his presence. Alternate translation: “will not continue to stay before God when he judges them” or “will have to leave God’s presence when he judges them as guilty” or 2) not standing in the judgment is a metaphor for being condemned in the judgment. “Alternate translation: “will be condemned in the judgment” or “will be condemned when God judges them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
The noun judgment can be expressed as a verb. This probably refers to the final judgment when God judges all people. Alternate translation: “when God judges everyone”
Translators can supply the verb “stand.” Alternate translation: “neither will sinners stand in the assembly of the righteous” or “and sinners will not stand in the assembly of the righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
Being accepted by God as righteous is spoken of as standing with the group of righteous people. Alternate translation: “and God will not accept sinners along with the righteous people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
These two clauses contrast what happens to righteous people with what happens to wicked people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
How people live is spoken of as if it were a “way” or “road” that they are walking on. Alternate translation: “how the righteous live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
How people live and what they do is spoken of as if it were a “way” or “road” that they walk on. Possible meanings are 1) the way perishing represents the wicked perishing because of how they live. Alternate translation: “The wicked will die because of how they live” or 2) the way perishing is a metaphor for no longer being able to live the way they do. Alternate translation: “the wicked will no longer be able to live the way they live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
