i
paul
write
this
letter
to
you
titus
i
am
a
servant
of
god
and
an
apostle
of
jesus
the
messiah
god
the
people
whom
he
has
chosen
as
his
own
what
is
true
they
can
live
in
a
way
that
pleases
god
his
people
can
learn
how
to
live
like
this
because
they
are
confident
that
god
will
cause
them
to
live
forever
god
even
before
he
promised
to
cause
us
to
live
forever
then
at
the
right
time
he
communicated
his
through
this
message
that
he
trusted
me
to
preach
i
do
this
in
order
to
obey
the
command
of
god
who
saves
us
i
am
writing
to
you
titus
you
have
become
like
a
real
son
to
me
because
we
both
now
believe
in
jesus
the
messiah
the
father
and
the
messiah
jesus
who
saves
us
continue
to
be
kind
to
you
and
to
give
you
a
peaceful
spirit
i
left
you
on
the
island
of
crete
for
this
reason
that
you
do
the
work
and
also
appoint
elders
for
the
group
of
believers
in
every
city
just
as
i
told
you
to
do
now
every
elder
must
be
someone
whom
no
one
can
criticize
he
must
also
have
just
one
wife
his
children
to
be
out
of
control
or
disobedient
is
like
someone
who
manages
god
s
house
so
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
good
reputation
he
should
not
be
proud
and
he
must
not
get
angry
quickly
he
must
not
be
an
alcoholic
not
someone
who
likes
to
fight
and
argue
and
not
a
greedy
man
rather
than
that
he
must
welcome
strangers
and
love
the
things
that
are
good
he
must
always
act
sensibly
and
treat
other
people
in
a
fair
and
honest
manner
he
must
always
act
in
a
way
that
is
right
for
someone
who
is
devoted
to
god
and
he
must
always
control
his
emotions
he
must
always
believe
the
true
things
and
he
must
live
according
to
them
to
persuade
people
too
and
in
order
to
correct
people
i
tell
you
these
things
because
there
are
many
people
what
these
people
say
has
no
value
the
people
who
are
the
most
like
this
are
the
ones
you
and
the
leaders
whom
you
appoint
should
prevent
such
people
from
teaching
the
believers
they
are
teaching
things
that
they
should
not
teach
causing
entire
families
to
believe
wrong
things
they
only
do
it
so
that
people
will
give
them
money
this
is
very
shameful
one
man
someone
his
people
said
cretans
are
always
lying
to
one
another
they
are
lazy
and
always
eat
too
much
food
is
true
correct
them
forcefully
so
that
they
may
believe
and
teach
they
should
stop
living
according
to
stories
invented
by
the
jews
and
commandments
that
came
from
people
not
god
people
who
have
stopped
obeying
everything
that
they
do
is
good
but
if
people
are
wicked
and
do
not
believe
in
the
messiah
jesus
such
people
s
even
though
they
claim
to
know
god
shows
that
they
do
not
know
him
they
are
disgusting
and
can
do
nothing
but
as
for
you
titus
you
must
teach
people
what
is
appropriate
behavior
tell
the
older
men
that
they
must
control
themselves
at
all
times
that
they
must
live
in
a
way
that
other
people
respect
and
that
they
must
act
sensibly
tell
them
that
they
must
also
tell
the
older
women
like
the
men
so
that
everyone
knows
that
they
respect
god
very
much
tell
them
that
they
must
not
say
mean
or
false
things
about
other
people
and
that
they
must
not
be
addicted
to
drinking
a
lot
of
wine
instead
they
should
teach
others
what
is
good
in
this
way
they
will
be
able
to
advise
the
younger
women
and
children
the
older
women
should
also
teach
the
younger
women
to
control
what
they
say
and
do
not
to
act
in
a
wrong
way
toward
any
man
to
work
well
at
home
and
to
do
what
husbands
tell
them
they
should
do
all
these
things
so
that
no
one
can
mock
urge
them
likewise
to
control
themselves
well
you
yourself
make
sure
that
everything
you
say
is
true
and
say
it
in
a
way
that
they
will
respect
teach
people
what
is
right
with
messages
that
no
one
can
criticize
so
that
if
anybody
other
people
will
shame
them
because
they
will
have
nothing
bad
that
they
can
justly
say
about
any
of
us
as
for
those
believers
who
are
slaves
teach
them
that
they
should
always
submit
to
their
masters
tell
them
to
live
in
a
way
that
pleases
their
masters
in
every
way
and
to
not
be
argumentative
with
them
they
must
not
steal
even
little
things
from
their
masters
instead
in
a
way
that
leads
people
to
admire
about
god
who
saves
us
the
believers
should
behave
in
these
good
ways
because
is
offering
to
save
by
means
of
this
free
gift
god
trains
us
to
stop
doing
what
is
wrong
and
what
people
of
the
world
want
to
do
he
teaches
us
to
be
sensible
and
to
obey
him
while
we
live
during
this
present
time
at
the
same
time
god
teaches
us
to
wait
for
what
he
will
certainly
do
in
the
future
which
is
something
that
will
make
us
very
happy
that
is
jesus
the
messiah
our
savior
and
powerful
will
return
to
us
he
gave
himself
to
die
for
us
as
the
payment
that
frees
us
from
and
to
remove
our
sin
from
us
so
that
we
can
be
a
people
who
are
his
special
possession
a
people
who
eagerly
desire
to
do
what
is
good
titus
speak
about
these
things
urge
the
believers
to
live
as
i
have
described
and
correct
them
when
they
do
not
using
titus
continue
to
tell
our
people
again
they
need
to
be
ready
to
do
good
they
should
not
say
disrespectful
things
about
anyone
they
should
be
peaceful
they
should
treat
gently
we
need
to
remember
that
there
was
a
time
when
were
foolish
and
unwilling
to
obey
god
our
own
passions
and
took
us
in
the
wrong
direction
and
we
served
them
as
if
we
were
their
slaves
we
were
constantly
envying
each
other
and
we
caused
people
to
hate
us
and
we
hated
each
other
but
when
god
showed
us
us
he
saved
us
by
removing
our
sin
as
though
he
had
washed
it
away
giving
us
a
new
birth
and
making
us
new
by
the
holy
spirit
he
did
not
save
us
because
we
things
but
he
saved
us
because
is
merciful
generously
us
his
holy
spirit
when
jesus
the
messiah
us
by
this
free
gift
god
has
declared
that
everything
is
made
right
between
him
and
us
he
gave
us
the
holy
spirit
so
that
we
can
share
in
everything
that
the
lord
jesus
has
to
give
us
everlasting
life
with
him
this
is
a
statement
that
everyone
can
trust
i
want
you
to
continually
emphasize
so
that
those
who
have
believed
god
may
constantly
devote
themselves
to
doing
those
things
that
are
good
and
that
help
others
these
things
are
excellent
and
beneficial
for
everyone
but
many
people
will
want
to
debate
with
you
about
senseless
things
such
as
about
lists
of
jewish
ancestors
they
will
want
to
argue
with
you
and
dispute
with
you
about
religious
law
stay
away
from
all
of
that
useless
and
they
do
not
help
you
in
any
way
if
someone
insists
on
engaging
in
these
divisive
activities
after
you
have
warned
him
one
or
two
times
to
stop
doing
it
then
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
because
you
know
that
has
rejected
the
truth
he
is
sinning
when
i
send
artemas
or
tychicus
to
you
do
your
best
to
come
to
me
at
the
town
of
nicopolis
because
i
have
decided
to
stay
there
for
the
winter
do
everything
you
can
to
equip
zenas
the
law
expert
and
apollos
for
their
journey
make
sure
that
learn
to
occupy
themselves
with
doing
good
things
for
by
doing
this
titus
all
those
who
are
with
me
greet
you
please
greet
for
us
us
to
all
of
you
