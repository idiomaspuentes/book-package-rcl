metaphor
what
is
a
metaphor
and
how
can
i
translate
a
bible
passage
that
has
one
description
a
metaphor
is
a
figure
of
speech
in
which
someone
speaks
of
one
thing
as
if
it
were
a
different
thing
because
he
wants
people
to
think
about
how
those
two
things
are
alike
for
example
someone
might
say
the
girl
i
love
is
a
red
rose
a
girl
and
a
rose
are
very
different
things
but
the
speaker
considers
that
they
are
alike
in
some
way
the
hearers
task
is
to
understand
in
what
way
they
are
alike
the
parts
of
a
metaphor
the
example
above
shows
us
that
a
metaphor
has
three
parts
in
this
metaphor
the
speaker
is
talking
about
the
girl
i
love
this
is
the
topic
the
speaker
wants
the
hearer
to
think
about
what
is
similar
between
her
and
a
red
rose
the
red
rose
is
the
image
to
which
he
compares
the
girl
most
probably
he
wants
the
hearer
to
consider
that
they
are
both
beautiful
this
is
the
idea
that
the
girl
and
the
rose
both
share
and
so
we
may
also
call
it
the
point
of
comparison
every
metaphor
has
three
parts
the
topic
the
item
being
immediately
discussed
by
the
writer
speaker
the
image
the
physical
item
object
event
action
etc
which
the
speaker
uses
to
describe
the
topic
the
idea
the
abstract
concept
or
quality
that
the
physical
image
brings
to
the
mind
of
the
hearer
when
he
thinks
of
how
the
image
and
the
topic
are
similar
often
the
idea
of
a
metaphor
is
not
explicitly
stated
in
the
bible
but
it
is
only
implied
from
the
context
the
hearer
or
reader
usually
needs
to
think
of
the
idea
himself
using
these
terms
we
can
say
that
a
metaphor
is
a
figure
of
speech
that
uses
a
physical
image
to
apply
an
abstract
idea
to
the
speakers
topic
usually
a
writer
or
speaker
uses
a
metaphor
in
order
to
express
something
about
a
topic
with
at
least
one
point
of
comparison
idea
between
the
topic
and
the
image
often
in
metaphors
the
topic
and
the
image
are
explicitly
stated
but
the
idea
is
only
implied
the
writer
speaker
often
uses
a
metaphor
in
order
to
invite
the
readers
listeners
to
think
about
the
similarity
between
the
topic
and
the
image
and
to
figure
out
for
themselves
the
idea
that
is
being
communicated
speakers
often
use
metaphors
in
order
to
strengthen
their
message
to
make
their
language
more
vivid
to
express
their
feelings
better
to
say
something
that
is
hard
to
say
in
any
other
way
or
to
help
people
remember
their
message
sometimes
speakers
use
metaphors
that
are
very
common
in
their
language
however
sometimes
speakers
use
metaphors
that
are
uncommon
and
even
some
metaphors
that
are
unique
when
a
metaphor
has
become
very
common
in
a
language
often
it
becomes
a
passive
metaphor
in
contrast
to
uncommon
metaphors
which
we
describe
as
being
active
passive
metaphors
and
active
metaphors
each
present
a
different
kind
of
translation
problem
which
we
will
discuss
below
passive
metaphors
a
passive
metaphor
is
a
metaphor
that
has
been
used
so
much
in
the
language
that
its
speakers
no
longer
regard
it
as
one
concept
standing
for
another
passive
metaphors
are
extremely
common
examples
in
english
include
the
terms
table
leg
family
tree
book
leaf
meaning
a
page
in
a
book
or
the
word
crane
meaning
a
large
machine
for
lifting
heavy
loads
english
speakers
simply
think
of
these
words
as
having
more
than
one
meaning
examples
of
passive
metaphors
in
biblical
hebrew
include
using
the
word
hand
to
represent
power
using
the
word
face
to
represent
presence
and
speaking
of
emotions
or
moral
qualities
as
if
they
were
clothing
patterned
pairs
of
concepts
acting
as
metaphors
many
ways
of
metaphorical
speaking
depend
on
pairs
of
concepts
where
one
underlying
concept
frequently
stands
for
a
different
underlying
concept
for
example
in
english
the
direction
up
the
image
often
represents
the
concepts
of
more
or
better
the
idea
because
of
this
pair
of
underlying
concepts
we
can
make
sentences
such
as
the
price
of
gasoline
is
going
up
a
highly
intelligent
man
and
also
the
opposite
kind
of
idea
the
temperature
is
going
down
and
i
am
feeling
very
low
patterned
pairs
of
concepts
are
constantly
used
for
metaphorical
purposes
in
the
worlds
languages
because
they
serve
as
convenient
ways
to
organize
thought
in
general
people
like
to
speak
of
abstract
qualities
such
as
power
presence
emotions
and
moral
qualities
as
if
they
were
body
parts
or
as
if
they
were
objects
that
could
be
seen
or
held
or
as
if
they
were
events
that
could
be
watched
as
they
happened
when
these
metaphors
are
used
in
normal
ways
it
is
rare
that
the
speaker
and
audience
regard
them
as
figurative
speech
examples
of
metaphors
in
english
that
go
unrecognized
are
turn
the
heat
up
more
is
spoken
of
as
up
let
us
go
ahead
with
our
debate
doing
what
was
planned
is
spoken
of
as
walking
or
advancing
you
defend
your
theory
well
argument
is
spoken
of
as
war
a
flow
of
words
words
are
spoken
of
as
liquids
english
speakers
do
not
view
these
as
metaphorical
expressions
or
figures
of
speech
so
it
would
be
wrong
to
translate
them
into
other
languages
in
a
way
that
would
lead
people
to
pay
special
attention
to
them
as
figurative
speech
for
a
description
of
important
patterns
of
this
kind
of
metaphor
in
biblical
languages
please
see
and
the
pages
it
will
direct
you
to
when
translating
something
that
is
a
passive
metaphor
into
another
language
do
not
treat
it
as
a
metaphor
instead
just
use
the
best
expression
for
that
thing
or
concept
in
the
target
language
active
metaphors
these
are
metaphors
that
people
recognize
as
one
concept
standing
for
another
concept
or
one
thing
for
another
thing
they
make
people
think
about
how
the
one
thing
is
like
the
other
thing
because
in
most
ways
the
two
things
are
very
different
people
also
easily
recognize
these
metaphors
as
giving
strength
and
unusual
qualities
to
the
message
for
this
reason
people
pay
attention
to
these
metaphors
for
example
for
you
who
fear
my
name
the
sun
of
righteousness
will
rise
with
healing
in
its
wings
malachi
4colon2
ult
here
god
speaks
about
his
salvation
as
if
it
were
the
sun
rising
in
order
to
shine
its
rays
on
the
people
whom
he
loves
he
also
speaks
of
the
suns
rays
as
if
they
were
wings
also
he
speaks
of
these
wings
as
if
they
were
bringing
medicine
that
would
heal
his
people
here
is
another
example
jesus
said
go
and
tell
that
fox
luke
13colon32
ult
here
that
fox
refers
to
king
herod
the
people
listening
to
jesus
certainly
understood
that
jesus
was
intending
for
them
to
apply
certain
characteristics
of
a
fox
to
herod
they
probably
understood
that
jesus
intended
to
communicate
that
herod
was
evil
either
in
a
cunning
way
or
as
someone
who
was
destructive
murderous
or
who
took
things
that
did
not
belong
to
him
or
all
of
these
active
metaphors
are
the
metaphors
that
need
special
care
to
translate
correctly
to
do
so
you
need
to
understand
the
parts
of
a
metaphor
and
how
they
work
together
to
produce
meaning
jesus
said
to
them
i
am
the
bread
of
life
he
who
comes
to
me
will
not
be
hungry
and
he
who
believes
in
me
will
never
be
thirsty
john
6colon35
ult
in
this
metaphor
jesus
called
himself
the
bread
of
life
the
topic
is
i
meaning
jesus
himself
and
the
image
is
bread
bread
was
the
primary
food
that
people
ate
in
that
place
and
time
the
similarity
between
bread
and
jesus
is
that
people
need
both
to
live
just
as
people
need
to
eat
food
in
order
to
have
physical
life
people
need
to
trust
in
jesus
in
order
to
have
eternal
life
the
idea
of
the
metaphor
is
life
in
this
case
jesus
stated
the
central
idea
of
the
metaphor
but
often
the
idea
is
only
implied
purposes
of
metaphor
one
purpose
of
metaphor
is
to
teach
people
about
something
that
they
do
not
know
the
topic
by
showing
that
it
is
like
something
that
they
already
do
know
the
image
another
purpose
is
to
emphasize
that
something
the
topic
has
a
particular
quality
the
idea
or
to
show
that
it
has
that
quality
in
an
extreme
way
another
purpose
is
to
lead
people
to
feel
the
same
way
about
the
topic
as
they
would
feel
about
the
image
reasons
this
is
a
translation
issue
people
may
not
recognize
that
something
is
a
metaphor
in
other
words
they
may
mistake
a
metaphor
for
a
literal
statement
and
thus
misunderstand
it
people
may
not
be
familiar
with
the
thing
that
is
used
as
an
image
and
so
not
be
able
to
understand
the
metaphor
if
the
topic
is
not
stated
people
may
not
know
what
the
topic
is
people
may
not
know
the
points
of
comparison
that
the
speaker
wants
them
to
understand
if
they
fail
to
think
of
these
points
of
comparison
they
will
not
understand
the
metaphor
people
may
think
that
they
understand
the
metaphor
but
they
do
not
this
can
happen
when
they
apply
points
of
comparison
from
their
own
culture
rather
than
from
the
biblical
culture
translation
principles
make
the
meaning
of
a
metaphor
as
clear
to
the
target
audience
as
it
was
to
the
original
audience
do
not
make
the
meaning
of
a
metaphor
more
clear
to
the
target
audience
than
you
think
it
was
to
the
original
audience
examples
from
the
bible
listen
to
this
word
you
cows
of
bashan
amos
4colon1
ult
in
this
metaphor
amos
speaks
to
the
upperclass
women
of
samaria
you
the
topic
as
if
they
were
cows
the
image
amos
does
not
say
what
similaritys
he
intends
between
these
women
and
cows
he
wants
the
reader
to
think
of
them
and
he
fully
expects
that
readers
from
his
culture
will
easily
do
so
from
the
context
we
can
see
that
he
means
that
the
women
are
like
cows
in
that
they
are
fat
and
interested
only
in
feeding
themselves
if
we
were
to
apply
similarities
from
a
different
culture
such
as
that
cows
are
sacred
and
should
be
worshipped
we
would
get
the
wrong
meaning
from
this
verse
note
amos
does
not
actually
mean
that
the
women
are
cows
he
speaks
to
them
as
human
beings
and
yet
yahweh
you
are
our
father
we
are
the
clay
you
are
our
potter
and
we
all
are
the
work
of
your
hand
isaiah
64colon8
ult
the
example
above
has
two
related
metaphors
the
topics
are
we
and
you
and
the
images
are
clay
and
potter
the
similarity
between
a
potter
and
god
is
the
fact
that
both
make
what
they
wish
out
of
their
material
the
potter
makes
what
he
wishes
out
of
the
clay
and
god
makes
what
he
wishes
out
of
his
people
the
idea
being
expressed
by
the
comparison
between
the
potters
clay
and
us
is
that
neither
the
clay
nor
gods
people
have
a
right
to
complain
about
what
they
are
becoming
jesus
said
to
them
take
heed
and
beware
of
the
yeast
of
the
pharisees
and
sadducees
the
disciples
reasoned
among
themselves
and
said
it
is
because
we
took
no
bread
matthew
16colon6dash7
ult
jesus
used
a
metaphor
here
but
his
disciples
did
not
realize
it
when
he
said
yeast
they
thought
he
was
talking
about
bread
but
yeast
was
the
image
in
his
metaphor
and
the
topic
was
the
teaching
of
the
pharisees
and
sadducees
since
the
disciples
the
original
audience
did
not
understand
what
jesus
meant
it
would
not
be
good
to
state
clearly
here
what
jesus
meant
