### Example

This component simply includes all the Book Package components onto
one page. It will validate `bookId` and `chapter`.

Optionally, a chapter in the book may be specified or a comma delimited list for multiple chapters.

The book identifiers are per standards found at:
http://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/identification/books.html

```js
<BookPackageTotals bookId='tit' delay='' iterations='' />
```
